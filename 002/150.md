# Users will lose rewards when they redelegate before claiming their rewards

### Summary

If a user delegates, undelegates, and delegates again(at different epochs), he will lose his rewards for the other previous delegation when he calls claim.


### Root Cause

When [delegating](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-morphl2/blob/main/morph/contracts/contracts/l2/staking/L2Staking.sol#L284), protocol does not ensure that rewards during the user's last delegation has been claimed, causing user to lose those rewards, as unclaimedStart gets [updated](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-morphl2/blob/main/morph/contracts/contracts/l2/staking/Distribute.sol#L112) regardless


### Internal pre-conditions

Say a user:
- delegates at epoch x
- undelegates at epoch x+y
- delegates again at epoch x+z
User loses rewards distributed between epoch x and x+y

### External pre-conditions

There is no external precondition

### Attack Path

Consider the following scenario:

- Alice delegates 100 morph at epoch 2
  - distributions mapping gets updated, unclaimedStart gets set to effectiveEpoch=currentEpoch+1=3
- Alice undelegates at epoch 6
  - unclaimedEnd gets set to effectiveEpoch-1=6
- Alice delegates 50 morph at epoch 20
  - distributions mapping gets updated, unclaimedStart gets set to 21
- When claiming, Alice cannot set targetEpochIndex to an epoch<21 due to [this check](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-morphl2/blob/main/morph/contracts/contracts/l2/staking/Distribute.sol#L339), which prevents her from claiming rewards from epoch 2 to 6
- These rewards get locked, as it cannot be claimed, and remainsNumber for that epochIndex can never reach 0

### Impact

Users will lose rewards when they redelegate before claiming their rewards

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

When a user delegates, his previous unclaimedEnd should be read, and unclaimed rewards up to unclaimedEnd should be claimed before updating unclaimedStart
