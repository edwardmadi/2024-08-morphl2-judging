# unclaimed[delegator].unclaimedStart[delegatee] = effectiveEpoch; will be incorrectly set in notifyDelegation() in the specified order

### Summary

We set the `unclaimed[delegator].unclaimedStart[delegatee] = effectiveEpoch;`  in [Distribute#notifyDelegation()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-morphl2/blob/main/morph/contracts/contracts/l2/staking/Distribute.sol#L94-L114),

 specifically when `bool newDelegation` is true as in this piece of code,

```solidity
if (newDelegation) {
            unclaimed[delegator].delegatees.add(delegatee);
            unclaimed[delegator].unclaimedStart[delegatee] = effectiveEpoch;
}
```
This is due to this equating to true -> [delegations[delegatee][_msgSender()] == amount](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-morphl2/blob/main/morph/contracts/contracts/l2/staking/L2Staking.sol#L329). 
Which will be the case when you delegate tokens for the **first time** and that's not an issue, 
but if you do the following actions step by step -> 
`L2Staking#delegateStake()`, `L2Staking#undelegateStake()`, `L2Staking#claimUndelegation()`, 
(you don't claim rewards, just claiming back the initial tokens we've deposited to the `delegatee`), 
and call `L2Staking#delegateStake()` for a **second time**, you will rewrite the previous 
[unclaimed[delegator].unclaimedStart[delegatee] = effectiveEpoch;](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-morphl2/blob/main/morph/contracts/contracts/l2/staking/Distribute.sol#L112), if we delegate to the same delegatee **both of the times**.

It will be treated as a **new delegation** and if you want to then claim the rewards via `L2Staking#claimReward()` for the specified  `delegatee` , it will start from the epoch that was ongoing in the **second call** of the `L2Staking#delegateStake()` 
due to `bool newDelegation` being true and overwriting `unclaimed[delegator].unclaimedStart[delegatee] = effectiveEpoch;`.

The second time we call `L2Staking#delegateStake()` , `bool newDelegation` is true is because we track it via `delegations[delegatee][_msgSender()] == amount` and in `L2Staking#undelegateStake()` we already deleted it through this line of code -> [delete delegations[delegatee][_msgSender()];](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-morphl2/blob/main/morph/contracts/contracts/l2/staking/L2Staking.sol#L360)

Because **we deleted the previous delegation** in the LOC above (`delete delegations[delegatee][_msgSender()];`) in `L2Staking#undelegateStake()` , and now during the second invocation of `L2Staking#delegateStake()`, 
this will equate to true -> `delegations[delegatee][_msgSender()] == amount` and consequently,
`bool newDelegation` will be again as a truthy value, which will cause `unclaimed[delegator].unclaimedStart[delegatee] = effectiveEpoch;` to be rewritten in the second time we invoke `L2Staking#delegateStake()`,  

### Root Cause

We do not send the reward tokens programmatically back to the user in the code, they are to be **claimed manually**, and rewriting of the `unclaimed[delegator].unclaimedStart[delegatee]` will render the rewards from the previous epoches **unclaimable**, because in the `Distribute#_claim()`, the [for loop](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-morphl2/blob/main/morph/contracts/contracts/l2/staking/Distribute.sol#L341) takes the `unclaimed[delegator].unclaimedStart[delegatee]` as a starting value to loop over

 Just a small note if you somehow think about it while reading the code:
 The number of `undelegateLockEpochs` that's used in `L2Staking#undelegateStake()`  doesn't matter to the vulnerability.
 
If its set to `5` epochs, we will have to wait for the `5` epochs to pass to be able to call `claimUndelegation()`, 
and it will still rewrite the `unclaimed[delegator].unclaimedStart[delegatee] = effectiveEpoch;` as explained,
when we call `L2Staking#delegateStake()` for a **second time**.

### Internal pre-conditions

All of the **used functions** in the example need to be using the same `delegatee`  (both `L2Staking#delegateStake()` invocations, `L2Staking#undelegateStake()`, `L2Staking#claimReward()`)

### External pre-conditions

### Attack Path

1. `Alice` decides to stake her 100 morph tokens to the `delegatee` named `Bob` using `L2Staking#delegateStake(Bob, 100)`. <br />
2. **5 epochs pass**, `Alice` decides that she needs those 100 morph tokens, so `Alice` calls `L2Staking#undelegateStake(Bob)`. <br />
3. `Alice` waits the specified `undelegateLockEpochs` and calls `L2Staking#claimUndelegation()` to claim her initial staked tokens. <br />3.1 **Note that** `L2Staking#claimUndelegation()` gives your initially staked tokens back only, the reward from the staked assets is 
 claimed via `L2Staking#claimReward(Bob)`. <br />
4. `Alice` can claim her rewards, but instead of claiming them now, 
she decides to call  `L2Staking#delegateStake(Bob, 100)`  again to stake her 100 morph tokens. <br />4.1 This is where **the vulnerability arises**, `Alice` **haven't claimed her rewards** and she calls `L2Staking#delegateStake(Bob, 100)` a second time,  which will overwrite the `unclaimed[delegator].unclaimedStart[delegatee] = effectiveEpoch;` to a new value, thus making the claiming of rewards **accrued in the epochs** from between the first `L2Staking#delegateStake()` and `L2Staking#undelegateStake()` that are described 
in `Step 1.` and `Step 2.`  **impossible** as the [for loop](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-morphl2/blob/main/morph/contracts/contracts/l2/staking/Distribute.sol#L341) in `Distribute#_claim()` 
(`Distribute#_claim()` is called from `Distribute#claim()`, which is called 
from `L2Staking.claimReward(delegatee, lastEpochIndex)`.
6. **3 epochs pass** and `Alice` decides that now its time **to claim her rewards** via `L2Staking#claimReward(Bob, targetEpochIndex)`, but she can **only claim the rewards only from the last 3 epochs** due to `unclaimed[delegator].unclaimedStart[delegatee] = effectiveEpoch;` being rewritten to a new epoch in as explained in `Step 4.`

### Impact

`Alice` **can't claim her rewards** from the staked assets if she calls `L2Staking#delegateStake(Bob, 100)` while having pending rewards, which will be case in our example, due to `unclaimed[delegator].unclaimedStart[delegatee] = effectiveEpoch;` being rewritten to a new epoch.

### PoC

### Mitigation

When a user invokes `L2Staking#undelegateStake()`, execute the `L2Staking#claimReward()` function in it, although we need to make `L2Staking#claimReward` `public` instead of its current access modifier `external`.
