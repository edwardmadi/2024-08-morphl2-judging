# Delegator loses rewards if he undelegates and afterwards delegates again before claiming rewards in `Distribute.sol`

### Summary

If a delegator undelegates and delegates again (which is totally viable, maybe they forget to claim their rewards, they just need to call `claimUndelegation` before delegating again, which does not claim their reward for them), they loose all their previously accrued rewards due to a missing check for whether the delegator still has pending rewards and resetting their pending rewards to zero.


### Root Cause

In [`L2Staking::delegateStake`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-morphl2/blob/98e0ec4c5bbd0b28f3d3a9e9159d1184bc45b38d/morph/contracts/contracts/l2/staking/L2Staking.sol#L287), it is only checked that there is no unclaimed delegation, by requiring `!_unclaimed`. Now this function just checks whether any `undelegations` have not been claimed yet by calling `claimUndelegation`. 

The problem is that this does not ensure that the delegator's pending rewards in the `Distribute` have been claimed yet. This contract keeps track of them by maintaining a delegator's `unclaimedStart` which is set in `Distribute::notifyDelegation`. If now a delegator delegates, accrues rewards, undelegates and then delegates again, `unclaimedStart` is reset to the current epoch. This makes it skip all the previous epochs in which the delegator already accrued rewards, making it impossible for him to claim them.

```solidity
function notifyDelegation(/*[...]*/) public onlyL2StakingContract {
    // [...]

    if (newDelegation) {
        unclaimed[delegator].delegatees.add(delegatee);
        unclaimed[delegator].unclaimedStart[delegatee] = effectiveEpoch; // <-----
    }
}
```

### Internal pre-conditions

None

### External pre-conditions

None

### Attack Path

Issue path in this case:

* delegator (`alice`) delegates to some delegatee
* `alice` keeps her delegation, accruing rewards over 10 epochs
* `alice` decides to undelegate for whatever reason and claims her undelegation in `L2Staking`
* `alice` then wants to delegate again and calls `L2Staking::delegateStake`
* she has now lost all her previously accrued rewards and put the `Distribute` contract into an unwanted state of having positions that cannot be removed anymore


### Impact

* Permanent loss of unclaimed rewards
* Unwanted state of the `Distribute` contract (unremovable positions)


### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Consider adding a call to `Distribute::queryUnclaimed`, checking whether the delegator still has any pending rewards before allowing him to delegate again.
