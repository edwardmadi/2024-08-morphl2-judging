# Successful governance proposals can fail to be executed

### Summary

Proposals in `Gov.sol` will expire immediately after `votingDuration` with no buffer to execute the proposal. In most cases, this is fine, as execution happens directly from inside the `vote()` function. However, there are situations when the proposal can be moved into a "passed" state without a call to `vote()`, and in these cases, there is no buffer between the end of voting and the expiration time to execute the proposal.

### Root Cause

In `Gov.sol`, proposals are usually executed automatically upon each vote if we've crossed the required threshold:
```solidity
function vote(uint256 proposalID) external onlySequencer {
    ...

    if (_checkPassed(proposalID)) {
        _executeProposal(proposalID);
    }
}
```
However, there is a situation where this execution during a vote will not be triggered. Specifically, if the sequencer set shrinks after the final vote, we can move into a situation where the proposal passed, but there is no `vote()` transaction to trigger it. This is because `_checkPassed()` operates off the current sequencer set, not a cached set from the beginning of the vote:
```solidity
function _checkPassed(uint256 proposalID) internal view returns (bool) {
    // checking invalidate votes
    address[] memory latestSequencerSet = ISequencer(SEQUENCER_CONTRACT).getSequencerSet2();
    uint256 validVotes = 0;
    for (uint256 i = 0; i < latestSequencerSet.length; i++) {
        if (votes[proposalID].contains(latestSequencerSet[i])) {
            validVotes = validVotes + 1;
        }
    }
    return validVotes > (latestSequencerSet.length * 2) / 3;
}
```
In this case, the call to [`executeProposal()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-morphl2/blob/main/morph/contracts/contracts/l2/staking/Gov.sol#L190-L196) will be required for the proposal to be executed.
```solidity
function executeProposal(uint256 proposalID) external {
    (bool finished, bool passed, ) = proposalStatus(proposalID);
    require(!finished, "voting has ended");
    require(passed, "proposal has not been passed yet");

    _executeProposal(proposalID);
}
```
However, this requires that the vote is not finished, where `finished` is defined as `executed || expirationTime == 0 || expirationTime < block.timestamp`, and `expirationTime` is `votingDuration` after the vote was created (set as 1 day in the [config](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1KDQ8LkB53yw7f0m8a0LCTIdyiANjKyqC-sKUQEQGSf8/edit?gid=0#gid=0)).

In other words, if a vote becomes "passed" by a change in the makeup of the sequencer set and then we cross 1 day since the start time without calling `executeProposal()` (this could happen arbitrarily soon after the vote passes), it is no longer able to be executed. This can reasonable cause approved votes to become non-executable on an unreasonable timeframe.

### Internal Preconditions

1. A vote must pass by a change in the sequencer set, as opposed to a new vote.

### External Preconditions

1. No user must call `executeProposal()` in the (arbitrarily short) time before the vote expires.

### Attack Path

1. A vote is created at timestamp 0.
2. Out of a group of 6 sequencers, 4 vote for it (not enough for > 2/3 quorum).
3. The sequencer set removes one of the members who voted no at timestamp 86,340 (1 minute before expiry).
4. The vote is passed, but nobody calls `executeProposal()` in the next minute.
5. The vote expires at timestamp 86,400, and the proposal is no longer executable.

### Impact

Successful votes can become non-executable in an arbitrary short timeframe.

### PoC

N/A

### Mitigation

Create an additional `executionTime` with an extra buffer after the vote ends to allow time for the proposal to be executed.
