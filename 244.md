### Summary

- https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-morphl2/blob/main/morph/contracts/contracts/l1/staking/L1Staking.sol#L181

If the staker decide not to withdraw funds, but became unavailable (key lose for example), then the staker will continue to hold the limited staker place. If many stakers became unavailable during the protocol time all 255 slots may be occupied by dead stakers and so rollup will stop working.
