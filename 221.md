# Reentrancy in claimUndelegation()

### Summary

The claimUndelegation() function transfers Morph tokens back to the user without updating the in delegations array until after the transfer. This opens up the contract to reentrancy attacks, where an attacker could repeatedly call claimUndelegation() to drain the contract before the undelegation data is properly updated

### Root Cause

The claimUndelegation() function transfers MORPH tokens before updating the undelegations array. This allows an attacker to exploit reentrancy, repeatedly withdrawing funds before the undelegation data is updated 

### Internal pre-conditions

1. The user needs to have undelegated tokens available for withdrawal 
2. The undelegations array needs to remain in-updated while the function is processing the token transfer

### External pre-conditions

1. An attacker needs to deploy a malicious contract capable of invoking reentrancy 
2. The gas prices need to remain low enough for the attacker to execute multiple transactions without high costs 

### Attack Path

1. The stakes 1,000 MORPH tokens and then calls claimUndelegation()
2. Before the undelegations array is updated, the attacker uses a malicious contract to call the function repeatedly, draining the contract 
3. The attack continues until the contract is drained or until the gas limit is reached 

### Impact

1. The attacker could withdraw 100x or more than their original stake. If multiple attackers exploit this, the protocol could lose 100,000 MORPH tokens or more, depending on the contract’s liquidity 
2. Users will lose access to their legitimate undelegations, and the contract’s staking pool will be depleted

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

- Apply check-effects-interactions pattern, where the undelegation array is updated before any token transfer occurs
