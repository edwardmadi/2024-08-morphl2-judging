# If users bridge NFTs from L2 to L1 and the recipient does not implement `onERC721/1155Received`, the NFTs will be permanently lost

### Summary

Sending `ERC721` or `ERC1155` tokens from `L2 -> L1` to a receiver which does not implement the respective `onERC*Received` functions will cause permanent loss of funds.


### Root Cause

Note: Here I will mainly use `ERC721` as an example but the issue is equally applicable to `ERC1155` tokens as they also make a callback on safe transfers.

[`L1ERC721Gateway.sol::finalizeWithdrawERC721`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-morphl2/blob/98e0ec4c5bbd0b28f3d3a9e9159d1184bc45b38d/morph/contracts/contracts/l1/gateways/L1ERC721Gateway.sol#L91-L104) uses `safeTransferFrom` to send the token to the receiving user.

```solidity
function finalizeWithdrawERC721(
    address _l1Token,
    address _l2Token,
    address _from,
    address _to,
    uint256 _tokenId
) external virtual onlyCallByCounterpart nonReentrant {
    // [...]
    IERC721Upgradeable(_l1Token).safeTransferFrom(address(this), _to, _tokenId);
    // [...]
}
```

### Internal pre-conditions

None

### External pre-conditions

Transfer destination does not implement `onERC721Received`


### Attack Path

Issue path in this case:

* User tries to transfer `ERC721` or `ERC1155` token from L2 to L1
* The destination is someone not implementing `onERC*Received`. This could for example be a Smart Wallet
* The batch containing that transfer gets finalized on L1
* User tries to withdraw NFT by calling `L1CrossDomainMessenger.sol::proveAndRelayMessage` with the proper withdrawal proof
* This calls `L1ERC721Gateway.sol::finalizeWithdrawERC721` which will fail as the destination (Smart Wallet) does not implement `onERC*Received`
* User lost NFT permanently

### Impact

Permanent loss of NFTs as `L2 -> L1` messages can also not be dropped.


### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Consider using `transferFrom` instead of `safeTransferFrom` in `L1ERC721Gateway.sol::finalizeWithdrawERC721` and `L1ERC1155Gateway.sol::finalizeWithdrawERC1155`.
