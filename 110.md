# L1Staking.claimWithdrawal becomes executable 1 block later than it should be per the invariants

## Summary
The problem is the comparison operator that is used in the `claimWithdrawals` checks series:
```solidity
        require(withdrawals[_msgSender()] < block.number, "withdrawal locked");
```
in the `claimWithdrawal` function, the withdrawer can only claim a withdrawal when not only the `withdrawalLockBlocks` N of blocks have passed, but also at least 1 more block has elapsed since that end time.

## Vulnerability Detail
That is because `<` is used instead of `<=`, which in this case is not accurate nor correct.

## Impact
Although it doesn't pose funds lose risks, but **it violates an invariant that a withdrawer can `claimWithdrawal` of their own once `block.number + withdrawalLockBlocks` has come in terms of time, and that is intuitively evident by looking at this comment**:
### State Variable: withdrawals
*Contract: L1Staking*
`/// @notice withdraw unlock block height`

Which implies that when that withdraw unlock block height is REACHED, the staker can ALREADY claim a withdrawal --- he shouldn't have to wait for 1 more block to elapse.

---

It is evident speicifically thanks to one more thing, in addition to the protocol's "`unlock block height`" comment about `withdrawals`:

The thing is that a similar approach of setting claimable/executable time was also applied to the stakers deletion logic, namely storing "`deletableAtBlockHeight`" block numbers in the `deleteableHeight` array:
```solidity
    /// @notice clean staker store
    function _cleanStakerStore() internal {
        uint256 i = 0;
        while (i < deleteList.length) {
            if (deleteableHeight[deleteList[i]] <= block.number) {
                // clean stakerSet
                delete stakerSet[stakerIndexes[deleteList[i]] - 1];
                delete stakerIndexes[deleteList[i]];

                // clean staker info
                delete stakers[deleteList[i]];

                // clean deleteList
                delete deleteableHeight[deleteList[i]];
                deleteList[i] = deleteList[deleteList.length - 1];
                deleteList.pop();
            } else {
                i++;
            }
        }
    }
```

Here can see the discrepancy in timing logic among the contract functions at this line: `if (deleteableHeight[deleteList[i]] <= block.number)`.

The `<=` operator is used.

Likely, in `L2Staking`, a similar `>=` approach is used in multiple places:
```solidity
    /// @notice start reward
    function startReward() external onlyOwner {
        require(block.timestamp >= rewardStartTime, "can't start before reward start time");
```

That is why I believe that in `claimWithdrawal` there should be a `withdrawals[_msgSender()] <= block.number` check instead of `withdrawals[_msgSender()] < block.number`.

## Tool used
Manual review.

## Recommendation
Update the `claimWithdrawal` function accordingly for the stakers to be able to timely claim withdrawals of their stakes:
```diff
    /// @notice claim withdrawal
    /// @param receiver  receiver address
    function claimWithdrawal(address receiver) external nonReentrant {
        require(withdrawals[_msgSender()] > 0, "withdrawal not exist");
-       require(withdrawals[_msgSender()] < block.number, "withdrawal locked");
+       require(withdrawals[_msgSender()] <= block.number, "withdrawal locked");

        delete withdrawals[_msgSender()];
        _cleanStakerStore();

        emit Claimed(_msgSender(), receiver);

        _transfer(receiver, stakingValue);
    }
```
