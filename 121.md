# Any changes to the gas limit or calldata gas on Ethereum will invalidate `MAX_OVERHEAD` and `getL1GasUsedBeforeCurie`

## Description and Vulnerability Detail
Ethereum gas are subject to change in the future, so we should avoid hardcoding or using constants for them in smart contracts.

The gas limit has changed many times in the past, as you can see here: https://etherscan.io/chart/gaslimit.

In January 2024, Vitalik Buterin considered increasing the gas limit by 33% to 40 million which you can see here: https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/191kke6/comment/kh7ekx3/?context=3&rdt=57176

The gas cost per non-zero byte was also changed in the past from 68 to 16 (in EIP-2028), and it could change again in the future.

## Impact
Any changes will invalidate MAX_OVERHEAD and getL1GasUsedBeforeCurie. We need to keep in mind that if anything changes, we may end up charging more or less gas, depending on the adjustment.


## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
My recommendation is that we should avoid hardcoding or using constants for the gas limit and calldata gas.
