# `burn()` will always revert in MorphToken contract

## Vulnerability Detail

The admin would be the owner of the MorphToken contract when initializing.
```solidity
File: MorphToken.sol

     function initialize(
       ...
93:     _transferOwnership(_owner);
```

In `mintInflations()`, we can see that it mints to `DISTRIBUTE_CONTRACT` address which is hardcoded. This function can only be called by the `RECORD_CONTRACT` which is evident because of the modifier `onlyRecordContract`.

```solidity
File: MorphToken.sol

        function mintInflations(uint256 upToEpochIndex) external onlyRecordContract {
         ...
 140:     _mint(DISTRIBUTE_CONTRACT, increment);
```
But during buring, we can see that the function can only be called by the owner.
```solidity
File: MorphToken.sol

    /// @dev Destroys `amount` tokens from `account`, reducing the total supply.
    /// @param amount amount to destroy
    function burn(uint256 amount) external onlyOwner {
        require(amount > 0, "amount to burn is zero");
        _burn(_msgSender(), amount);
    }
```
## Impact
- Since the tokens are minted to `DISTRIBUTE_CONTRACT`, then during burning when the owner calls `burn()`, it would revert because nothing was minted to the owner in the first place.
- Also there isn't any `_transferOwnership()` inside the contract where the ownership is transferred to `DISTRIBUTE_CONTRACT` so that it can burn the tokens.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
If the `mintInflations()` is only callable by the `RECORD_CONTRACT`, then the `burn()` should also be called by the same & the `_msgSender()` should be changed to `DISTRIBUTE_CONTRACT` because it is the only address where the tokens are being minted to.
