# Missing BLS Signature Verification in commitBatch() Method

## Summary:

https://github.com/morph-l2/morph/blob/main/contracts/contracts/l1/staking/L1Staking.sol#L324

https://github.com/morph-l2/morph/blob/main/contracts/contracts/l1/rollup/Rollup.sol#L201

https://github.com/morph-l2/morph/blob/main/contracts/contracts/l1/rollup/Rollup.sol#L312

 commitBatch() method of the RollUp contract relies on the verifySignature() function in L1Staking contract for BLS signature verification of batch submissions. 



However, the verifySignature() function has not been implemented, leaving the rollup system vulnerable to unauthorized and fraudulent batch submissions. 



This issue undermines the core security mechanisms of the rollup, including batch validation, slashing mechanisms, and fraud detection.





## Vulnerability Details


The verifySignature() method is supposed to authenticate batch submitters (sequencers) by verifying their BLS signatures against a provided message hash and sequencer set. 



However, since this function is not implemented, any entity, including malicious actors, can submit batches without being properly authenticated.




The rollup relies on the assumption that all submitted batches are signed by authorized stakers, but due to this missing verification, it is impossible to enforce that rule. This opens up the system to various security risks, including unauthorized submissions and the breakdown of the consensus mechanism.



## Code snippet 

```sol

  function verifySignature(

        uint256, // signedSequencersBitmap

        address[] calldata, // sequencerSet

        bytes32, // msgHash

        bytes calldata // signature

    ) external pure returns (bool) {

        // TODO verify BLS signature

        return true;

    }

```





## Impact:

Unauthorized Batch Commitments:
Without signature verification, unauthorized or malicious actors can submit batches to the rollup. These batches could include invalid or fraudulent transactions, compromising the rollup's integrity.

Consensus Breaking:
The rollup depends on batches being committed by authorized sequencers. If unauthorized batches are committed, it could lead to state inconsistencies between the rollup (Layer 2) and the base chain (Layer 1). This could break consensus, leading to potential forks or invalid state transitions.

Inability to Slash Malicious Actors:
The lack of BLS signature verification prevents the slashing mechanism from functioning. Malicious sequencers cannot be punished for submitting invalid batches since there is no way to verify their signatures. This undermines the security of the rollup and enables malicious behavior without consequences.

Vulnerability to Sybil Attacks:
Without proper checks on who is allowed to submit batches, the rollup is vulnerable to Sybil attacks, where a malicious actor could create multiple identities and submit invalid or unauthorized batches without fear of punishment.

Finality Compromise and Fraud Detection Failure:
Fraud proofs and challenges rely on the assumption that batches are initially submitted by authorized actors. Without BLS signature verification, fraudulent batches could pass through undetected, and fraud proofs may not be sufficient to revert the damage. This undermines the rollup's finality guarantees.


## Tools Used:

Manual review 



Recommendations:

Implement BLS Signature Verification:
Complete the implementation of the verifySignature() method in the L1Staking contract. 

The function should properly validate BLS signatures using the public keys of authorized sequencers, ensuring that only valid and authorized batches are submitted.
Strengthen Slashing Mechanisms:

Ensure that the slashing mechanisms are functional and able to detect and punish sequencers that submit invalid or unauthorized batches. This will require proper signature verification to detect misbehavior.


Implement Fraud Proofs and Recovery Mechanisms:
Ensure that fraud proofs can effectively detect invalid batch submissions and revert the rollupâ€™s state to prevent long-term state inconsistencies.
