# Unvalidated Token Pairing in `finalizeWithdrawERC20` Allows Unauthorized Token Transfers

## Summary
The `finalizeWithdrawERC20` function in the `L1ERC20Gateway` abstract contract lacks validation to ensure that the `_l1Token` and `_l2Token` are a legitimate pair. This vulnerability can be exploited by malicious actors to withdraw tokens using incorrect or unauthorized token pairings, potentially leading to unauthorized token transfers and asset loss.

## Vulnerability Detail
The function `finalizeWithdrawERC20` does not include checks to verify that the `_l1Token` and `_l2Token` are correctly paired. This lack of validation allows for the of incorrect token pairings being processed.
```solidity
54:     function finalizeWithdrawERC20(
55:         address _l1Token,
56:         address _l2Token,
57:         address _from,
58:         address _to,
59:         uint256 _amount,
60:         bytes calldata _data
61:     ) external payable virtual override onlyCallByCounterpart nonReentrant {
62:         _beforeFinalizeWithdrawERC20(_l1Token, _l2Token, _from, _to, _amount, _data);
---
66:@=>      IERC20Upgradeable(_l1Token).safeTransfer(_to, _amount);
---
68:         _doCallback(_to, _data);
---
70:         emit FinalizeWithdrawERC20(_l1Token, _l2Token, _from, _to, _amount, _data);
71:     }
```
A malicious user could exploit this vulnerability by calling `finalizeWithdrawERC20` with a legitimate `_l1Token` but an incorrect or unauthorized `_l2Token`. This would allow them to withdraw tokens from the contract without proper authorization, leading to unauthorized token transfers.

## Impact
- Unauthorized token transfers.
- The vulnerability can be exploited repeatedly, leading to significant asset loss over time.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Implement a validation mechanism to ensure that `_l1Token` and `_l2Token` are a legitimate pair before proceeding with the withdrawal. This can be achieved by maintaining a mapping of valid token pairs and checking against it.
```diff
// Mapping to store valid L1 and L2 token pairs
+ mapping(address => address) private validTokenPairs;

function finalizeWithdrawERC20(
    address _l1Token,
    address _l2Token,
    address _from,
    address _to,
    uint256 _amount,
    bytes calldata _data
) external payable virtual override onlyCallByCounterpart nonReentrant {
    // Validate token pair
+   require(validTokenPairs[_l1Token] == _l2Token, "Invalid token pair");

    _beforeFinalizeWithdrawERC20(_l1Token, _l2Token, _from, _to, _amount, _data);

    IERC20Upgradeable(_l1Token).safeTransfer(_to, _amount);

    _doCallback(_to, _data);

    emit FinalizeWithdrawERC20(_l1Token, _l2Token, _from, _to, _amount, _data);
}

// Function to set valid token pairs (should be restricted to admin or owner)
+ function setValidTokenPair(address _l1Token, address _l2Token) external onlyOwner {
+   validTokenPairs[_l1Token] = _l2Token;
}
```
