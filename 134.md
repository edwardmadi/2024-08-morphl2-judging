# L1CrossDomainMessenger contract has Unexpected Ether Balance

### **Unexpected Ether Balance**

---

**Impact:** 
The contract includes several payable functions (sendMessage, replayMessage) that handle Ether transfers. However, it lacks a receive or fallback function, meaning that Ether sent directly to the contract address without invoking a specific function will be stuck in the contract with no mechanism for retrieval.
 
The `L1CrossDomainMessenger` contract lacks a `receive` or `fallback` function. Consequently, any Ether sent directly to the contract address without invoking a specific function will be **trapped** within the contract. This can lead to unintended accumulation of Ether, potentially locking funds and causing operational issues.

**Vulnerable Code:**

        bytes memory _message,
        uint256 _gasLimit

```
```sol
    function replayMessage(
        address _from,
        address _to,
        uint256 _value,
        uint256 _messageNonce,
        bytes memory _message,
        uint32 _newGasLimit,
        address _refundAddress
    ) external payable override whenNotPaused notInExecution {...
```

**Foundry Coded POC:**
Suffix this contract below to the foundry test file path following.
```txt
morph/contracts/contracts/test/L1CrossDomainMessenger.t.sol
```
```solidity
import "../../lib/forge-std/src/Test.sol";

contract UnexpectedEtherBalanceTest is Test {
    L1CrossDomainMessenger messenger;

    function testUnexpectedEtherBalance() public {
        // Attempt to send Ether directly to the contract without calling any function
        (bool success, ) = address(messenger).call{value: 1 ether}("");
        //assertTrue(success, "Direct Ether transfer should fail");
    }
}
```

```

**Solidity Coded Mitigation:**

Implement a `receive` and/or `fallback` function to handle unexpected Ether transfers appropriately. If the contract should not accept direct Ether transfers, it is advisable to revert the transaction.

```solidity
// Add the following to the contract

receive() external payable {
    revert("Direct Ether transfers not allowed");
}

fallback() external payable {
    revert("Direct Ether transfers not allowed");
}
```

**Location:**  
- **File:** `L1CrossDomainMessenger.sol`  
- **Lines:** *No existing `receive` or `fallback` function present*  
- **Proposed Addition:** Near the end of the contract, before the closing brace
