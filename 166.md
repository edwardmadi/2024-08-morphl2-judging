# If many stakers get slashed at once or the admin removes many stakers at once, those stakers can never be removed from the staker set on L2

### Summary

If multiple stakers are removed at once, `L1Staking.sol::_msgRemoveStakers` invokes `L2Staking.sol::removeStakers` with an array of stakers. This call on L2 does a lot of storage writes. If now the array of stakers to be removed is too big (`~40 stakers`), it will run OOG (`gasLimitRemoveStakers = 8_000_000`) and fail. This will cause the stakers to be removed on L1 but not on L2. Since stakers on L2 can only be removed by cross-chain calls and not even by an admin, this means the stakers contained in that transaction can never be removed on L2.


### Root Cause

Now the rootcause is not that easy to narrow down as the problem is basically that [`L2Staking.sol::removeStakers`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-morphl2/blob/98e0ec4c5bbd0b28f3d3a9e9159d1184bc45b38d/morph/contracts/contracts/l2/staking/L2Staking.sol#L173-L202) makes a lot of storage writes, costing a lot of gas. Being limited to `8mil` gas then, is also not beneficial (Note that even the block gas limit of `10mil` is not enough if the array has a size of`~50 stakers`). Therefore I will take the point where it is preventable as the rootcause. This is, that there is no limitation on the size of `remove` passed to `_msgRemoveStakers`. In the worst case, it can be called with `255` stakers which is way too much to be successful on L2.


### Internal pre-conditions

None

### External pre-conditions

None

### Attack Path

Now there are two ways how this can happen:
1) The admin removes more than `~40` stakers at once. This is quite reasonable since it is only `40/255 = ~15.7% of the staker set`. In this case it would happen without the knowledge of the admin as the L1 transaction will just succeed as normal
2) `~15.7%` of the sequencers act maliciously and trigger this on purpose to be unremovable from the L2 sequencer set
   1) Once multiple sequencers are required to sign a batch, every signer of a batch gets put into the `remove` array passed to `_msgRemoveStakers`
   2) This then triggers the bug on L2, causing the stakers to be slashed on L1 but since they will now earn rewards on L2 forever essentially since they cannot be removed, they will even be financially incentivized to do so. Also with this they maintain permanent voting power on L2 which is also quite valuable


### Impact

L2 sequencers will be impossible to remove from the sequencer set. Also there will be a discrepancy between stakers on L1 and L2 even though those should always be synchronized, breaking an invariant.


### PoC

To show that the call on L2 will run OOG, please add the following test to `L2Staking.t.sol` and execute it with `forge test --match-test test_removeStakers_OOG -vvvv`. This will show that the call to `removeStakers` takes more than `8mil` gas when the passed array contains `40 stakers`.

        address staker = address(uint160(beginSeq + i));
        Types.StakerInfo memory stakerInfo = ffi.generateStakerInfo(staker);

        // Expect the SequencerSetMaxSizeUpdated event is emitted successfully.
        hevm.expectEmit(true, true, true, true);
        emit IL2Staking.StakerAdded(stakerInfo.addr, stakerInfo.tmKey, stakerInfo.blsKey);
        l2Staking.addStaker(stakerInfo);
    }
    console.log("stakerAddressesLength: ", l2Staking.getStakerAddressesLength());
    hevm.stopPrank();

    hevm.startPrank(alice);
    morphToken.approve(address(l2Staking), type(uint256).max);
    l2Staking.delegateStake(address(uint160(beginSeq + 149)), 100);
    hevm.stopPrank();

    uint256 stakerSize = 40;

    // best case removal order
    address[] memory stakers = new address[](stakerSize);
    for (uint256 i = SEQUENCER_SIZE; i < stakerSize; ++i) {
        stakers[i] = address(uint160(beginSeq + i));
    }

    hevm.mockCall(
        address(l2Staking.MESSENGER()),
        abi.encodeCall(ICrossDomainMessenger.xDomainMessageSender, ()),
        abi.encode(address(l2Staking.OTHER_STAKING()))
    );

    hevm.startPrank(address(l2CrossDomainMessenger));
    l2Staking.removeStakers(stakers);
}
```

### Mitigation

As mentioned in `Root Cause`, the best way to fix this, is to add a limit to `L1Staking.sol::_msgRemoveStakers` on how many stakers can be removed with one cross-chain message. If the passed array exceeds that length, it could be split up into multiple arrays, sent with multiple cross-chain calls.
