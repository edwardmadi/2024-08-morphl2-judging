# Incorrect memory space is allocated in an assembly block

## Summary
In the `Rollup` contract, in the function `commitBatch` there is an assembly block which is allocating a memory pointer in an incorrect way.

## Vulnerability Detail
See the first block where `batchDataInput.chunks` is type `[]bytes`:

```solidity
uint256 _chunksLength = batchDataInput.chunks.length;
...
uint256 dataPtr;
assembly {
        dataPtr := mload(0x40)
        mstore(0x40, add(dataPtr, mul(_chunksLength, 32))) 
}
```

See the second block, where `BATCH_HEADER_FIXED_LENGTH = 249` is `uint256 constant` and `batchDataInput.skippedL1MessageBitmap` is type `bytes`.
```solidity
uint256 _headerLength = BatchHeaderCodecV0.BATCH_HEADER_FIXED_LENGTH +
        batchDataInput.skippedL1MessageBitmap.length;
assembly {
        _batchPtr := mload(0x40)
        mstore(0x40, add(_batchPtr, mul(_headerLength, 32))) 
}
```

The problem is, that the `mul` should no be used in the second case, instead a simple addition should be performed `add(_batchPtr, _headerLength))`. 

Why? Because we use array of `[]bytes` in the first case, it means that every single item in the array **is a word aka 32 bytes**. It means we have to multiply length with 32 to allocate enough memory.

However in the second case `_headerLength` is the value representing the total length of the batch header which is:
`constant (number of bytes) + bitmap length (number of bytes)` hence the `_headerLength` is already measured in bytes.
As a result we are allocating 32 times more memory.

## Impact
What does is mean.. In a most basic case where `skippedL1MessageBitmap.length == 0` we will assign a value 249*32=7968 to the free memory pointer (0x40), instead of 249.

In a case where `skippedL1MessageBitmap.length > 0`, for every single byte in `skippedL1MessageBitmap` we will allocate 32 times more. Example where  `skippedL1MessageBitmap.length == 500` we will assign a value (249+500)*32=23968 to the free memory pointer (0x40), instead of 749.

How big problem it is? 

The function will most likely do the job, however the gas can become problematic and unimplemented functions may become problematic. With `skippedL1MessageBitmap`, which is unbounded because it is a dynamic type `bytes`, the function can become overly expensive. The function is already quite complex and computational heavy. There is also an extreme scenario - based on the docs and documents provided, the team is aware of potential ZK circuit overflow. To avoid overflow to happen, some transactions have to be skipped. That's where `skippedL1MessageBitmap` come in to play. What if:

* big amount of transaction that can cause ZK circuit overflow are submitted
* they have to be skipped, otherwise overflow happen and system will panic
* the bitmap size increases dramatically and big amount of memory is allocated
* the price of batch submitting become overly expensive or even cause out-of-gas error

Where does it leave the system? TXs have to be skipped, but batch committing is not possible.. It feels like DoS unless some manual action is performed. However this attack feels rather expensive without real profit to attacker profit.

----
Final note:

Several functions are not yet implemented. Some of them are even called from the vulnerable function (`_getValidSequencerSet`, `_getBLSMsgHash`). More code followed after wrong memory allocation, higher risk of unexpected behavior.

## Recommendation
Remove multiplication from the assembly block.

```solidity
uint256 _headerLength = BatchHeaderCodecV0.BATCH_HEADER_FIXED_LENGTH +
        batchDataInput.skippedL1MessageBitmap.length;
assembly {
        _batchPtr := mload(0x40)
        mstore(0x40, add(_batchPtr, _headerLength)) 
}
```
