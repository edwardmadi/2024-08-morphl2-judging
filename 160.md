# The current implementation of function `L1Staking::verifySignature` always returns `true` without really verifying the BLS signature

## Summary
This issue is quite straight forward as the function `L1Staking::verifySignature` currently has a very problematic implementation. It always returns `true` without really verifying the BLS signature provided.

## Vulnerability Detail
The vulnerability in this `verifySignature` function lies within its logic handling - specifically, the unconditional return value of `true`. This poses a significant security risk as it implies that the function doesn't actually verify the provided signature against the `msgHash` or validate the signature according to the sequencer set and signed sequencers bitmap.

## Impact
Since the function returns `true` regardless of the input arguments, this means anyone can bypass signature verifications that rely on this function, leading to unauthorized actions or misuse of privileged functionalities that depend on proper signature validations. For example, the `RollUp::commitBatch` function will be impacted and the whole consensus verification design of the protocol is compromised -- a batch can be submitted by a malicious sequencer and committed even though it didn't obtain the consensus among other sequencers at all.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
To resolve this vulnerability, the function must be properly implemented to conduct legitimate cryptographic checks against BLS signatures using the provided parameters or assert a relationship between the bitmap, sequencer set, message hash, and the signature.
