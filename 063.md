# Potentially Stuck ETH from Incorrect Data Parameter

## Vulnerability Detail

In the [L2CrossDomainMessenger](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-morphl2/blob/main/morph/contracts/contracts/l2/L2CrossDomainMessenger.sol) contract, specifically the bridging process, the [_executeMessage](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-morphl2/blob/main/morph/contracts/contracts/l2/L2CrossDomainMessenger.sol#L125-L152) function is called when transferring assets from L1 to L2. If a user accidentally sets a value in the _message field, but either the _to address is an EOA, the message is in an incorrect format, or the address is a contract that does not support the data in this field, the user's assets will be stuck on L1, as the L1 transaction has succeeded but the L2 transaction will fail.

Then, the message execution on L2 will fail. The `_executeMessage` function on L2 handles the message execution:
```solidity
    /// @dev Internal function to execute a L1 => L2 message.
    /// @param _from The address of the sender of the message.
    /// @param _to The address of the recipient of the message.
    /// @param _value The msg.value passed to the message call.
    /// @param _message The content of the message.
    /// @param _xDomainCalldataHash The hash of the message.
    function _executeMessage(
        address _from,
        address _to,
        uint256 _value,
        bytes memory _message,
        bytes32 _xDomainCalldataHash
    ) internal {
        // @note check more `_to` address to avoid attack in the future when we add more gateways.
        require(_to != Predeploys.L2_TO_L1_MESSAGE_PASSER, "Forbid to call l2 to l1 message passer");
        _validateTargetAddress(_to);

        // @note This usually will never happen, just in case.
        require(_from != xDomainMessageSender, "Invalid message sender");

        xDomainMessageSender = _from;
        // solhint-disable-next-line avoid-low-level-calls
        (bool success, ) = _to.call{value: _value}(_message);
        // reset value to refund gas.
        xDomainMessageSender = Constants.DEFAULT_XDOMAIN_MESSAGE_SENDER;

        if (success) {
            isL1MessageExecuted[_xDomainCalldataHash] = true;
            emit RelayedMessage(_xDomainCalldataHash);
        } else {
            emit FailedRelayedMessage(_xDomainCalldataHash);
        }
    }
}
```
Replaying the message does not resolve the issue because the `_message` field cannot be changed for a replay. Additionally, if the transaction was not skipped, `dropMessage` cannot be called to obtain a refund. As a result, users have no means to recover their assets once the bridging transaction fails on L2 due to incorrect parameters.
## Impact
Users may irreversibly lose their assets due to input errors when bridging from L1 to L2.
## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
To avoid funds being lost when bridging, consider adding a way for users to be refunded when the bridging transaction cannot be completed (for example, when the transaction reverts or is skipped).

 Implementing a refund mechanism will allow users to retrieve their assets if the L2 execution fails, ensuring that funds are not permanently stuck due to incorrect input parameters.
