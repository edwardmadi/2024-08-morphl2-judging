# Unbounded Batch Size in finalizeBatchWithdrawERC721 Leading to Potential Out-of-Gas Errors and Denial of Service (DoS)

## Summary

https://github.com/morph-l2/morph/blob/main/contracts/contracts/l1/gateways/L1ERC721Gateway.sol#L107

The finalizeBatchWithdrawERC721 function in the L1ERC721Gateway contract allows multiple NFTs to be withdrawn in one transaction by providing an array of token IDs (uint256[] calldata _tokenIds). However, there is no limit imposed on the size of the _tokenIds[] array. 



This unbounded growth can lead to excessive gas consumption, potentially resulting in out-of-gas errors or Denial of Service (DoS) attacks. Attackers or users submitting overly large batches of token withdrawals could cause the function to revert due to exceeding the block gas limit, thereby preventing legitimate users from interacting with the contract.



## Vulnerability Details

The _tokenIds[] array used in the finalizeBatchWithdrawERC721 function has no maximum size limit, allowing users to submit a large number of token IDs in a single transaction.



 Each ERC721 token transfer using safeTransferFrom consumes a significant amount of gas (approximately 50,000-100,000 gas per transfer). As the number of tokens in the batch grows, the gas required for the transaction increases linearly.



If the number of tokens in a batch is too large, the total gas consumption for the transaction could exceed the Ethereum block gas limit (approximately 30 million gas), causing the transaction to fail with an out-of-gas error.



## Impact

An attacker could submit large batches that exceed the block gas limit, causing the transaction to revert and potentially blocking other users from withdrawing their NFTs.


 Large batches of token withdrawals will lead to out-of-gas errors, causing the transaction to fail and potentially wasting gas fees for the user.


If unbounded batches are continually submitted, the contract could become inoperable for withdrawals, disrupting the normal operation of the system and affecting user experience.







## Recommendations

Implement a Maximum Batch Size for _tokenIds[]:
Introduce a reasonable limit on the size of the _tokenIds[] array to prevent unbounded growth. For example:

```sol

uint256 constant MAX_BATCH_SIZE = 250;  // Adjust based on gas estimates

require(_tokenIds.length <= MAX_BATCH_SIZE, "Batch size exceeds maximum limit");
```
