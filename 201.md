# Reentrancy Vulnerability in `_withdraw` Function of `L2CustomERC20Gateway` Contract

## Summary
The[ L2CustomERC20Gateway](morph/contracts/contracts/l2/gateways/L2CustomERC20Gateway.sol) contract contains a potential reentrancy vulnerability in the [_withdraw](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-morphl2/blob/main/morph/contracts/contracts/l2/gateways/L2CustomERC20Gateway.sol#L108) function due to its reliance on the burn function from the `IMorphERC20Upgradeable` contract, which may lack proper reentrancy protection. It poses a significant risk to user funds and the integrity of the contract's operations

## Vulnerability Detail

The [_withdraw](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-morphl2/blob/main/morph/contracts/contracts/l2/gateways/L2CustomERC20Gateway.sol#L108) function in the `L2CustomERC20Gateway` contract incorporates the [nonReentrant](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-morphl2/blob/main/morph/contracts/contracts/l2/gateways/L2CustomERC20Gateway.sol#L114) modifier to mitigate the risk of reentrancy attacks. However, it subsequently invokes the [burn](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-morphl2/blob/main/morph/contracts/contracts/l2/gateways/L2CustomERC20Gateway.sol#L127) method from the `IMorphERC20Upgradeable` contract, which may not have equivalent protections against reentrancy. This presents a potential vulnerability where an attacker could exploit the situation by recursively calling the `_withdraw` function before the initial call is completed, thereby draining funds from the contract. 

```solidity 
function _withdraw(
        address _token,
        address _to,
        uint256 _amount,
        bytes memory _data,
        uint256 _gasLimit
    ) internal virtual override nonReentrant {
        address _l1Token = tokenMapping[_token];
        require(_l1Token != address(0), "no corresponding l1 token");

        require(_amount > 0, "withdraw zero amount");

        address _from = _msgSender();
        if (router == _from) {
            (_from, _data) = abi.decode(_data, (address, bytes));
        }

        IMorphERC20Upgradeable(_token).burn(_from, _amount);
```
While the `nonReentrant` modifier safeguards the function itself, it performs an external call to the [burn](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-morphl2/blob/main/morph/contracts/contracts/l2/gateways/L2CustomERC20Gateway.sol#L127) function before finalizing all state changes and cross-chain communications. If the `burn` function in the token contract does not implement adequate reentrancy protection, an attacker could exploit the mechanism, executing multiple withdrawals and potentially draining a greater amount of tokens than they are entitled to.


## Impact
An attacker could drain the funds from the `L2CustomERC20Gateway` contract, if the reentrancy vulnerability is exploited. This could lead to immediate financial losses for users who have deposited tokens or funds in the contract, as their assets could be withdrawn without authorization.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

1. Ensure that the` burn` function in the `IMorphERC20Upgradeable` contract includes a reentrancy guard. This can be done by using the `nonReentrant` modifier or a similar mechanism.
2. Modify the `_withdraw` function to follow the checks-effects-interactions pattern. This involves performing all checks and state changes before making external calls.
