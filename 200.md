# The onlyOwner modifier on the burn functionality of MorphToken means that only the owner can burn tokens that they own.

### Summary

The burnable function doesn't need access restrictions as the caller is burning the token they own.

### Root Cause

In `MorphToken.sol:149` the burning functionality is restricted to only the owner and only the owner can burn the token that they own.

```js
@->    function burn(uint256 amount) external onlyOwner {
        require(amount > 0, "amount to burn is zero");
        _burn(_msgSender(), amount);
    }
```

```diff
-   function burn(uint256 amount) external onlyOwner {
+   function burn(uint256 amount) external {
        require(amount > 0, "amount to burn is zero");
        _burn(_msgSender(), amount);
    }
```
