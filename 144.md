# Unclaimable Morph Tokens will gradually accumulate in `Distribute.sol`

## Summary
Morph Token will gradually accumulate and become stuck in [`Distribute.sol`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-morphl2/blob/98e0ec4c5bbd0b28f3d3a9e9159d1184bc45b38d/morph/contracts/contracts/l2/staking/Distribute.sol#L11) with each Reward Epoch. This can grow to a significant amount over time.

## Vulnerability Detail
During each reward Epoch in L2, the delegators receive staking rewards and the sequencers receive a % of this reward for their work in the form of Morph Tokens. This amount is freshly minted in every reward Epoch.

The Epoch Reward flow is as follows :
- `recordRewardEpochs()` is called in `Record.sol` by the Oracle address
-  This function calls `mintInflations()` in `MorphToken.sol`, which mints the Epoch reward to the `Distribute.sol` contract. The information for each delegator's reward is also updated in `Distribute.sol`.
- Delegators can claim their rewards through `L2Staking.sol`'s `claimReward()` function, which calls the `claim()` or `claimAll()` function in `Distribute.sol`
- Both these functions call the underlying `_claim()` function which returns the amount of Morph Tokens to be sent to the user

For this flow, let's calculate the amount of Morph token that is minted vs the amount that is actually sent to users as rewards.

Currently, there can be at max 7 sequencers in the protocol. [Source](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1KDQ8LkB53yw7f0m8a0LCTIdyiANjKyqC-sKUQEQGSf8/edit?gid=0#gid=0)

```solidity
            for (uint256 j = 0; j < dataLen; j++) {
                require(_rewardEpochs[i].sequencerCommissions[j] <= 20, "invalid sequencers commission");
                ratioSum += _rewardEpochs[i].sequencerRatios[j];
                blockCount += _rewardEpochs[i].sequencerBlocks[j];

                // compute rewards per sequencer
                uint256 reward = (inflationAmount * _rewardEpochs[i].sequencerRatios[j]) / PRECISION;
                commissions[j] = (reward * _rewardEpochs[i].sequencerCommissions[j]) / 100;
                delegatorRewards[j] = reward - commissions[j];
            }
```

In the code above, the `inflationAmount` is the amount of newly minted Morph Tokens. Due to rounding down, in the `reward` calculation, `0.5` Morph token will be unaccounted for. Note that the rounding down in `commissions[j]` is accounted for in `delegatorRewards[j]`. This will happen 7 times and hence the total unaccounted Morph Tokens will be `3.5`.

**NOTE : These calculations assume the average case, where the remainder is 0.5**

After this, in the `_claim` function, this calculation takes place :

```solidity
  reward +=
                (distributions[delegatee][i].delegatorRewardAmount * distributions[delegatee][i].amounts[delegator]) /
                distributions[delegatee][i].delegationAmount;
```
This rounds down too, which means `0.5` Morph token will be unaccounted for per delegator per delegatee.

So the total amount lost and stuck in `Distribute.sol` per reward Epoch comes out to be `3.5+ (sum of the number of delegators per sequencer)/2`

[According to the docs](https://docs.morphl2.io/docs/how-morph-works/decentralized-sequencers/morph-staking-system-design/#:~:text=These%206%25%20will%20be%20distributed%20everyday%20(one%20day%20is%20an%20epoch)%20to%20all%20the%20current%20running%20sequencers.), one reward Epoch takes place everyday. Depending on the number of delegators (which can be large amount since delegation is permisionless), the amount lost per day can be significant.

Example calculations of amount of Morph token stuck per year :

- 5000 delegators : 925275
- 50000 delegators : 9252750
- 500000 delegators : 92527500

The above calculations reveal that a small amount of Morph token stuck due to rounding down per Epoch can grow to a significant number over time.

## Impact
Medium - Since the amount is less but not finite. The dust amount will accumulate indefinitely and depending on the price of the Morph token this may be significant.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
A very simple fix is to add a function that allows the `Distribute.sol` Owner to retrieve the stuck tokens / redistribute them along with each Reward Epoch.
A more complex solution would be to implement `SafeMathLib` and account for every last Morph Token by appropriately rounding up / down.
