# Replay attack may possible due to not adding `chainId` in the `_structHash` calculation.



## Vulnerability Detail
The function `sendTransaction()` is used to add an enforced transaction to L2. It appears that the function is using EIP-712. This can be inferred from the use of the `_hashTypedDataV4` function and the structured way the transaction data is being hashed. 

```solidity
bytes32 _structHash = keccak256(
    abi.encode(_ENFORCED_TX_TYPEHASH, _sender, _target, _value, _gasLimit, keccak256(_data), _nonce, _deadline)
);
```

The issue is that in the `_structHash` calculation, it doesn't consider the `chainId` to protect against replay attacks. The absence of `chainId` in this calculation means that a signed transaction intended for one chain could potentially be replayed on another chain that uses the same contract address.

Also, `_ENFORCED_TX_TYPEHASH` doesn't include the `chainId`:

```solidity
    bytes32 private constant _ENFORCED_TX_TYPEHASH =
        keccak256(
            "EnforcedTransaction(address sender,address target,uint256 value,uint256 gasLimit,bytes data,uint256 nonce,uint256 deadline)"
        );
```

```solidity
    function sendTransaction(
        address _sender,
        address _target,
        uint256 _value,
        uint256 _gasLimit,
        bytes calldata _data,
        uint256 _deadline,
        bytes memory _signature,
        address _refundAddress
    ) external payable whenNotPaused {
        // solhint-disable-next-line not-rely-on-time
        require(block.timestamp <= _deadline, "signature expired");

        uint256 _nonce = nonces[_sender];
        bytes32 _structHash = keccak256(
            abi.encode(_ENFORCED_TX_TYPEHASH, _sender, _target, _value, _gasLimit, keccak256(_data), _nonce, _deadline) // chainID @audit
        );
        unchecked {
            nonces[_sender] = _nonce + 1;
        }

        bytes32 _hash = _hashTypedDataV4(_structHash);
        address _signer = ECDSAUpgradeable.recover(_hash, _signature);

        // no need to check `_signer != address(0)`, since it is checked in `recover`.
        require(_signer == _sender, "Incorrect signature");

        _sendTransaction(_sender, _target, _value, _gasLimit, _data, _refundAddress);
    }
```
## Impact
The lack of `chainId` in the `_structHash` calculation exposes to potential cross-chain replay attacks. An attacker could take a valid signed transaction from one chain and submit it on another chain where the same contract is deployed. This could lead to unintended transactions being executed on different chains, potentially resulting in financial losses or other unintended consequences for users.
