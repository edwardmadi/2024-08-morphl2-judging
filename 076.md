# Challengers can lose ETH

## Summary
Challengers can lose  ETH and incur financial losses 

## Vulnerability Detail
According to the readMe https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-morphl2-Pascal4me#q-additional-audit-information , financial losses stemming from L1 reorgs are valid. In `Rollup.sol ` , we all know that when committing batches it is done in an indexed manner so a challenger can lose ETH in this way.
 A batch is committed and gets batch index of 10, a challenger then quickly challenges that  batch index 10  but in a different block (remember challenger will rush to challenge as there might be other challengers), Ethereum re-orgs and the block that contains the batch 10 commitment tx is dropped and the contract goes back to having just 9 batches, batch committment tx goes back to the mempool, there is a possibility that another whole different batch is committed before that re-orged one and it's assigned the batch index 10. Then if that new batch 10 is correct, staker will prove it and challenger will lose challengeDeposit as challenges are stored to indexes not to batch hashes. And you can't undo a challenge 

## Impact
Loss of eth for challenger

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Attach batch hash to indexes as they are being challenged.
