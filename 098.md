# `L2Staking.sol` and `Sequencer.sol` will not function as intended

### Summary

When `L2Staking.sol` and `Sequencer.sol` are deployed, they do not correctly set all the necessary parameters. Many of these parameters will not be able to be reset in the future (for example, because owner will remain set to `address(0)`), which will cause various problems.

### Root Cause

In both `L2Staking.sol` and `Sequencer.sol`, the `initialize()` function is used to set important parameters. In the event that the `initialize()` function is not callable, some of these parameters will be permanently locked, as there is no other way to set them.

In the Genesis deployment process, [both of these contracts have their `_initialized` flag set](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-morphl2/blob/main/morph/ops/l2-genesis/morph-chain-ops/genesis/config.go#L516-L523) (blocking future initialization), but do not set the necessary parameters.
```go
storage["L2Staking"] = state.StorageValues{
	"_initialized":  1,
	"_initializing": false,
}
storage["Sequencer"] = state.StorageValues{
	"_initialized":  1,
	"_initializing": false,
}
```
Specifically, on [L2Staking.sol](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-morphl2/blob/main/morph/contracts/contracts/l2/staking/L2Staking.sol):
- `owner` is not set and cannot be set later, so will remain as the zero address
- `undelegateLockEpochs` will not be set and cannot be set later, so will remain as 0
- `sequencerMaxSize` and `rewardStartTime` should be able to be set later, but cannot be without contract ownership
- `stakers` is not set, but will be updated later by calls from L1

On [Sequencer.sol](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-morphl2/blob/main/morph/contracts/contracts/l2/staking/Sequencer.sol):
- `owner` is not set and cannot be set later, so will remain as the zero address
- `sequencerSet` is not set, but can be set later

### Internal Preconditions

None

### External Preconditions

None

### Attack Path

N/A

### Impact

The `L2Staking.sol` and `Sequencer.sol` contracts will be deployed with incorrect parameters, which will cause various problems (for example, inability to update ownerOnly parameters, the ability to unlock delegations immediately, etc).

Note that there are requirements that `undelegateLockEpochs > 0` and `sequencerMaxSize > 0`, and both of these invariants will be broken by this issue.

### PoC

N/A

### Mitigation

Update the Genesis deployment process to set the necessary parameters for `L2Staking.sol` and `Sequencer.sol` during deployment.
