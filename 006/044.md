# Multiple public view functions in the contract `Record` are suffering potential index out of bounds error, which means potential DOS issue for all of them

## Summary
All the three public view functions of `getBatchSubmissions`, `getRollupEpochs` and `getRewardEpochs` are suffering the same type of potential index out of bounds error, due to the same root cause of improperly assigning values directly to `res[i]`.

## Vulnerability Detail
The vulnerability in the code lies in the looping mechanism used to populate the `res` array. The index `i` is used to access elements from the `batchSubmissions` array and also used improperly to assign these values directly to `res[i]`, where `i` starts from `start` and ends at `end`. This leads to a potential index out of bounds error. The array `res` is created with the size `(end - start + 1)`, but its indices naturally start from `0` and go up to `(end - start)`. When the loop uses `i` directly ranging from `start` to `end` to index into `res`, in the case of the `start` not being `0`, eventually at some point it will incorrectly try to access indices that do not exist in `res`.

## Impact
In all cases as long as the `start` is not `0`, all these functions will DOS. Hence, all the design around these functions goes in vain. After confirming with the sponsor team about the importance of these functions, I learned that - quoting from the sponsors - "_**The sequencer is currently obliged to undertake the rollup work as a submitter, and this data will be used as the basis for issuing rewards and subsidies.**_" Therefore, these functions are the dependencies of the incentive mechanism for the decentralized sequencers to keep the chain rolling. If these functions collapse, it will negatively impact the motivation of the sequencers so the whole chain's functioning is at risk. From this perspective, this issue is considered having **HIGH** severity.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Using the `getBatchSubmissions` as an example, just change the buggy code below
```solidity
        for (uint256 i = start; i <= end; i++) {
            res[i] = batchSubmissions[i];
        }
``` 
to the correct code below:
```solidity
        for (uint256 i = 0; i <= end - start; i++) {
            res[i] = batchSubmissions[i+start];
        }
``` 
And, also change it similarly in the other two functions `getRollupEpochs` and `getRewardEpochs`.
