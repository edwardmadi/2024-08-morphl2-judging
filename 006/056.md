# Set of get functions always revert if `start > 0`

## Summary
Three view functions in the `Record` contract are incorrectly implemented and they revert with array out-of-bounds error if `start > 0`. Expected behavior is to return list from the range [start, end].

## Vulnerability Detail
These listed functions have an identical implementation 

* `getBatchSubmissions`
* `getRollupEpochs`
* `getRewardEpochs`

```solidity
function getRewardEpochs(uint256 start, uint256 end) external view returns (RewardEpochInfo[] memory res) {
    require(end >= start, "invalid index");
    res = new RewardEpochInfo[](end - start + 1);
    for (uint256 i = start; i <= end; i++) {
        res[i] = rewardEpochs[i];  //  accessing uninitialized mapping index
    }
}
```

Function revert because it is trying to assign value to out-of-bounds index.

Example: 
```bash
start = 2, end = 10
res = [] (size 10-2+1==9)

loop iterates over a set: [2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10]
but res[] was initialized to access only following indexes: [0,1,2,3,4,5,6,8]
```

This way we will see revert when accessing `res[i>8]`

## Impact
The issue breaks contract functionality and users won't be able to obtain important information published by oracle. Additionally it can hinder the integration with external systems expecting the function to return oracle-provided data. Users decisions may depend on actual information provided by oracle.

## Recommendation

`res[i - start] = rewardEpochs[i];`
