# getRollupEpochs in Record.sol is completely broken for any start value > 0 and will revert, making itself unusable

## Summary
The `getRollupEpochs` function doesn't operate correctly at all: any time it is called, it will revert.

### Please note that it is very critical because `Record.sol` will be used as a native predeploy contract.

## Vulnerability Detail
The problem is in using `i = start` as the `res`'s index here:
```solidity
    /// @notice get rollup epochs
    /// @param start start index
    /// @param end   end index
    function getRollupEpochs(uint256 start, uint256 end) external view returns (RollupEpochInfo[] memory res) {
        require(end >= start, "invalid index");
        res = new RollupEpochInfo[](end - start + 1);
        for (uint256 i = start; i <= end; i++) {
            res[i] = rollupEpochs[i]; // here is the problem
        }
    }
```

The function will always revert for any `start` that is larger than `0`, i.e. the first index of the array.

---

Setting the `res[i]` value here is not correct at all: that is because `i` may be any `start` offset, but the `res` should act as a slice or a cut, i.e. that it should be `i - start` instead.

Each time the function is called, the Out-of-Bounds array revert exception will be thrown, making it completely unusable.

## Impact
This critical deviation from the expected behavior may affect the end integrators, and is in general a broken function.

## PoC

You can confirm it yourselves. Please modify the `Record.t.sol` file in the following manner:
```solidity
    /**
     * @notice getRollupEpochs: rollup epochs still reverts despite good params
     */
    function test_getRollupEpochs_still_reverts_despite_good_params() public {
        hevm.prank(oracleAddress);
        record.getRollupEpochs(1, 2);
    }
```

You'll see that even with correct indices passed, `record.getRollupEpochs(1, 2)` keeps reverting.

### I also tested it in a Solidity sandbox, and unless a `res[i - start]` modification is applied, the function will always revert at any `start` that is larger than `0`.

## Tool used
Manual review.

## Recommendation
This should make the function workable again:
```diff
    /// @notice get rollup epochs
    /// @param start start index
    /// @param end   end index
    function getRollupEpochs(uint256 start, uint256 end) external view returns (RollupEpochInfo[] memory res) {
        require(end >= start, "invalid index");
        res = new RollupEpochInfo[](end - start + 1);
        for (uint256 i = start; i <= end; i++) {
-           res[i] = rollupEpochs[i];
+           res[i - start] = rollupEpochs[i];
        }
    }
```
