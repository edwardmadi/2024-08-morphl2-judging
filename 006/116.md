# Record.sol's getRewardEpochs function always reverts for any start index value larger than 0

## Summary
The `getRewardEpochs` function doesn't operate correctly at all: any time it is called, it will revert.


### Please note that it is very critical because `Record.sol` will be used as a native predeploy contract.

## Vulnerability Detail
The problem is in using `i = start` as the `res`'s index here:
```solidity
    /// @notice get reward epochs
    /// @param start start index
    /// @param end   end index
    function getRewardEpochs(uint256 start, uint256 end) external view returns (RewardEpochInfo[] memory res) {
        require(end >= start, "invalid index");
        res = new RewardEpochInfo[](end - start + 1);
        for (uint256 i = start; i <= end; i++) {
            res[i] = rewardEpochs[i]; // here is the problem with res[i]
        }
    }
```

The function will always revert for any `start` that is larger than `0`, i.e. the first index of the array.

---

Setting the `res[i]` value here is not correct at all: that is because `i` may be any `start` offset, but the `res` should act as a slice or a cut, i.e. that it should be `i - start` instead.

Each time the function is called, the Out-of-Bounds array revert exception will be thrown, making it completely unusable.


### I also tested it in a Solidity sandbox, and unless a `res[i - start]` modification is applied, the function will always revert at any `start` that is larger than `0`.


## Impact
This critical deviation from the expected behavior may affect the end integrators, and is in general a broken function. It's definitely not correct that the `start` index, initially intended to act as a pivot for the array slicing and as a utility for the users and integrators, potentially also used by other MorphL2's contracts, causes a revert each time when its value is larger than `0`.

## PoC

You can confirm it yourselves. Please modify the `Record.t.sol` file in the following manner:
```solidity
    /**
     * @notice getRewardEpochs: it reverts in any case when start is larger than 0
     */
    function test_getRewardEpochs_params_still_reverts() public {
        hevm.expectRevert("invalid index");
        hevm.prank(oracleAddress);
        record.getRewardEpochs(1, 2);
    }
```

You'll see that even with correct indices passed, `record.getRewardEpochs(1, 2)` keeps reverting too! You can test this for any in-bounds values with `start` `>` `0`.

## Tool used
Manual review.

## Recommendation
This should make the function workable again:
```diff
    /// @notice get reward epochs
    /// @param start start index
    /// @param end   end index
    function getRewardEpochs(uint256 start, uint256 end) external view returns (RewardEpochInfo[] memory res) {
        require(end >= start, "invalid index");
        res = new RewardEpochInfo[](end - start + 1);
        for (uint256 i = start; i <= end; i++) {
-           res[i] = rewardEpochs[i];
+           res[i - start] = rewardEpochs[i];
        }
    }
```
