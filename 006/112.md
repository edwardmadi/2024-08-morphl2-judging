# In Record.sol, getBatchSubmissions never works and is a priori completely broken

## Summary
The `getBatchSubmissions` function doesn't operate correctly at all: any time it is called, it will revert.


### Please note that it is very critical because `Record.sol` will be used as a native predeploy contract.

## Vulnerability Detail
The problem is in using `i = start` as the `res`'s index here:
```solidity
    /*************************
     * Public View Functions *
     *************************/

    /// @notice getBatchSubmissions
    /// @param start start index
    /// @param end   end index
    function getBatchSubmissions(uint256 start, uint256 end) external view returns (BatchSubmission[] memory res) {
        require(end >= start, "invalid index");
        res = new BatchSubmission[](end - start + 1);
        for (uint256 i = start; i <= end; i++) {
            res[i] = batchSubmissions[i]; // here is the problem!
        }
    }
```

The function will always revert for any `start` that is larger than `0`, i.e. the first index of the array.

---

Setting the `res[i]` value here is not correct at all: that is because `i` may be any `start` offset, but the `res` should act as a slice or a cut, i.e. that it should be `i - start` instead.

Each time the function is called, the Out-of-Bounds array revert exception will be thrown, making it completely unusable.

## Impact
This critical deviation from the expected behavior may affect the end integrators, and is in general a broken function.

### I also tested it in a Solidity sandbox, and unless a `res[i - start]` modification is applied, the function will always revert at any `start` that is larger than `0`.


## PoC

You can confirm it yourselves. Please modify the `Record.t.sol` file in the following manner:
```solidity
    function test_getBatchSubmissions_paramsCheck_reverts() public {
        hevm.expectRevert("invalid index");
        hevm.prank(oracleAddress);
        record.getBatchSubmissions(2, 1);
    }

        /**
     * @notice getBatchSubmissions: reverts in any case
     */
    function test_getBatchSubmissions_still_reverts() public {
        hevm.prank(oracleAddress);
        record.getBatchSubmissions(1, 2);
    }
```

You'll see that even with correct indices passed, `record.getBatchSubmissions(1, 2)` keeps reverting.

## Tool used
Manual review.

## Recommendation
This should make the function workable again:
```diff
    /*************************
     * Public View Functions *
     *************************/

    /// @notice getBatchSubmissions
    /// @param start start index
    /// @param end   end index
    function getBatchSubmissions(uint256 start, uint256 end) external view returns (BatchSubmission[] memory res) {
        require(end >= start, "invalid index");
        res = new BatchSubmission[](end - start + 1);
        for (uint256 i = start; i <= end; i++) {
-           res[i] = batchSubmissions[i];
+           res[i - start] = batchSubmissions[i];
        }
    }
```
