# Lack of input validation on reward claims

### Summary

The claim and claimAll functions do not validate if the targetEpochIndex is within the valid range.Malicious actors could attempt to claim rewards for epochs beyond what they are eligible for or trigger unexpected behaviour.

###Root Cause

In the claim function there is a lack of validation ensuring that the reward value being transferred matches the expected reward value of epoch.Specifically, the abstract of verification that the delegatorâ€™s reward calculation is accurate leaves the function vulnerable to incorrect or malicious manipulation of reward transfers.

### Internal pre-conditions

1. The delegator needs to have an unclaimed reward from a delegatee in the distribution mapping 
2. The delegator needs to initiate the claim or claimAll function
3. The number of epochs (endEpochIndex) must be greater than or equal to unclaimed 

### External pre-conditions

1. The delegator must not have claimed rewards for some epochs
2. The gas price needs to be low enough to incentivise repeated claims from malicious actors 

### Attack Path

1. The malicious actor (delegator) calls claim function, exploiting the incorrect reward calculation
2. The protocol executes the _claim function without properly verifying the calculated reward
3. The protocol transfers an incorrect reward amount to the delegator 
4. The delegator repeats the process, accumulating more tokens than expected 

### Impact

The protocol suffers a loss of reward tokens proportional to the number of affected epochs, as incorrect rewards are transferred to the attacker 
Honest delegators may lose their rewards for future claims of the rewards pool is depleted 

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Add a check to ensure that the total rewards transferred to a delegator over multiple epochs matches the expected reward
