# Failed cross-chain contract calls from L1Staking cannot be handled because the onDropMessage function is missing

## Summary and Vulnerability Detail
Whenever a staker is added or removed, a cross-chain contract call is made from L1Staking to L2Staking. These cross-chain calls may fail due to gas issues(Cross-layer messages sent from the L1 to the L2 might fail during execution on the L2 due to limitations in gasLimit or code logic) or skipped messages(Some data executions may trigger overflows in the circuits of L2 nodes, leading to the omission or skipping of cross-layer messages).

I will explain an attack scenario that could cause a gas issue with the removeStakers function, which can also be applied to the addStaker function:
Scenario: Let's say the owner calls updateGasLimitRemoveStakers to adjust the gas limit fees based on the current state, which were lower at the time. A malicious validator delays including this transaction, waiting for an opportunity to attack (essentially postponing it). Later, when a function like removeStaker or slash is called, triggering the execution of _msgRemoveStakers with a larger staker list, the attacker includes the owner's updateGasLimitRemoveStakers transaction just before the removeStaker or slash transaction. This causes the gas limit to be insufficient to execute the transaction, but still enough to pass _validateGasLimit in the L1MessageQueueWithGasPriceOracle contract.

Immediately after, the attacker calls replayMessage with a very low _newGasLimit. Why? Because if the attacker doesn't act, someone else could increase the gas limit. By calling replayMessage on the L1CrossDomainMessenger three times, the attacker ensures there is no opportunity to increase the gas limit. Now It can be applied if crosschain call skipped.

we should also keep in mind that messages can be skipped, as mentioned in the documentation: 'Skipped Message: Some data executions may trigger overflows in the circuits of L2 nodes, leading to the omission or skipping of cross-layer messages.'

## Impact
The impact is High because the sequencer will not be added to L2Staking, preventing it from participating in block production.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
My recommendation is to implement an onDropMessage function. In this function, we can recreate the cross-chain message with a higher gas limit. The flow would be: MESSENGER.dropMessage → L1Staking.onDropMessage → MESSENGER.sendMessage.
