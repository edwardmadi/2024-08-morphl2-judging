# A whole batch of message is skipped when commiting a new batch

## Summary
A whole batch of message is skipped when commiting a new batch 

## Vulnerability Detail
When committing a new batch, `BatchHeaderCodecV0.getTotalL1MessagePopped()` is called to get the total messages popped from all batches. The issue is that `Rollup.sol` assumes that  `BatchHeaderCodecV0.getTotalL1MessagePopped()` returns all the messages popped for all batches when it actually returns all the messages popped for all batches before the inputted batch; that is if there are 5 batches and batch 5 is inputted it returns the total number of message popped from batch 1 to 4 excluding batch 5 but `Rollup.sol` assumes batch 5 was included and this is used to implement the whole process of adding a batch from committing chunks to getting L1 messsage hashes etc. So only batch 1 to 4 are actually used in the logic instead of batch 1 to 5 and which is a very costly mistake as batches will never be correctly committed as they were intended to. Moreover, total message popped is updated in the function and stored and will be used to process the next batch. This assumption is also somewhat seen when finalizing a batch and `_popL1Messages()` is called which takes an input of  `BatchHeaderCodecV0.getTotalL1MessagePopped()`.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
When calling `BatchHeaderCodecV0.getTotalL1MessagePopped()` and you truly intend to get all message popped for all committed batches call https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-morphl2/blob/main/morph/contracts/contracts/libraries/codec/BatchHeaderCodecV0.sol#L67-L74  with the last committed batch and add the both values to get the correct value.
