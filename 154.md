# Oracle calls to update the sequencers rewards for each epoch will keep failing causing rewards to be stuck.

### Summary

Three nested and unbounded loops are run each time the oracle calls `Record::recordRewardEpochs` function in order to update the sequencers rewards for an epoch. These loops are shown below;

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-morphl2/blob/main/morph/contracts/contracts/l2/staking/Record.sol#L199

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-morphl2/blob/main/morph/contracts/contracts/l2/staking/Distribute.sol#L170

The exponential growth of these loops with each new sequencer added will make gas required to call `Record::recordRewardEpochs` function exceed block size limit. Then, rewards will not be updated or claimed but they will be stuck in the contract.

### Root Cause

Three unbounded nested loops in `Record::recordRewardEpochs` function.

### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

Sequencers, delegators and delegatees rewards for each epoch will be stuck. 

### PoC

When the oracle calls `Record::recordRewardEpochs` function, it calls the `Distribute::updateEpochReward` in turn order to update the sequencers reward for an epoch. In this transaction two nested, unbounded loops in line 173 and 199 in `Record::recordRewardEpochs` and one unbounded loop in line 170 of the `Distribute::updateEpochReward` function will be executed to complete the transaction. With every new sequencer added to the network, the loops length grow exponentially so also the gas required to complete this transaction. 
The gas required will eventually exceed the block gas limit. At this point, every calls to `Record::recordRewardEpochs` function will fail and rewards data for each epochs will not be updated, nor can the sequencers and other participants claim their rewards. The rewards becomes stuck.

### Mitigation

The `Record::recordRewardEpochs` function needs to be reviewed and refactored and if loops are necessary, their lengths must be retricted to reasonable values.
