# Missing `reverse` gateway for `ERC721` and `ERC1155` tokens, breaking core functionality

### Summary

The current system supports transfers of L2-native and L1-native `ERC20` tokens, however for `ERC721` and `ERC1155` only L1-native tokens are supported, making it impossible to transfer L2-native NFTs from `L2 -> L1`.


### Root Cause

The `L1/L2ReverseERC721/1155Gateway`s are missing. Currently there are L1 and L2 gateways for `ERC721` and `ERC1155` tokens however those only operate based on the following principle:
1) `L1 -> L2`
   1) Transfer token to L1 gateway
   2) Mint token to the user L2
2) `L2 -> L1`
   1) Burn token in the L2 gateway
   2) Transfer token from L1 gateway to user

The problem is that this is only possible for L1-native tokens. If we were to try this with an L2-native token, first of all the gateway would not have enough privileges to `burn` or `mint` such a token on L2 and secondly, the L1 gateway cannot transfer a token which it does not possess.


### Internal pre-conditions

None

### External pre-conditions

None

### Attack Path

* Someone deploys an NFT collection on L2
* User tries to bridge it to L1
* This fails / is not possible

### Impact

Missing core functionality. Looking at the handling of `ERC20` tokens, we can see that it should be possible to also bridge L2-native funds to L1 as there are `reverse` gateways for `ERC20` tokens which makes it possible for them.


### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Consider adding `reverse` gateways for `ERC721` and `ERC1155` tokens, reversing the type of operations (`mint/burn` on L1 and locking on L2).
