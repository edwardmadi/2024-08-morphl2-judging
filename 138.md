# Partial undelegations are not supported

### Summary

Partial undelegations are not supported

### Root Cause

Partial undelegations are not supported. If the staker requires liquidity, they cannot partially undelegate their stake, they must undelegate the full amount.

[L2Staking.sol#L342](https://github.com/morph-l2/morph/blob/main/contracts/contracts/l2/staking/L2Staking.sol#L342)
```solidity
    /// @notice delegator unstake morph
    /// @param delegatee delegatee address
    function undelegateStake(address delegatee) external nonReentrant {
        ...
    }
```
When this occurs, the have to wait the `undelegateLockEpochs` number of epochs to retrieve their funds and then redelegate again. As a result, they will lose `undelegateLockEpochs` amount of rewards from not delegating.

### Internal pre-conditions
