# During a withdraw in `L1Staking.sol` when a user is not able to claim his amount before the `withdrawalLockBlocks`, Eth will forever be locked in this contract.

## Summary
When unstaking Eth from the L1Staking contract, users are given a window between the current block(the one they are withdrawing from) upto a period when `withdrawalLockBlocks` ends. 

After this block in case a user has not withdrawn his eth, it will forever be locked in the contract with nothing like a rescue function to withdraw it.

## Vulnerability Detail
The withdraw process in L1Staking takes places in two steps, a staker first call `L1Staking.sol::Withdraw` and then `L1Staking.sol::claimWithdrawal`. 

But calling `L1Staking.sol::claimWithdrawal` is time limited since after `withdrawalLockBlocks` number of blocks, the user will nolonger be allowed to call and withdraw his amount.

```Solidity
     require(withdrawals[_msgSender()] < block.number, "withdrawal locked");
```

The above check ensures that a user won't be able to to withdraw after `withdrawalLockBlocks`, hence the value will forever remain in the contract.

The problem arises that this contract lacks a function that can help to rescue such tokens or value meaning that this eth will forever be locked in the contract.

## Impact
Mishandling of Eth and Loss of tokens

## Recommendation
Consider implementing a function that can recover tokens that are stuck in this contract.
