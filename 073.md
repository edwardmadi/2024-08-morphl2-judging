# User can frontrun slashing by withdrawing

### Description
Letâ€™s consider a scenario where Bob is about to be slashed. This would trigger the [`slash`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-morphl2/blob/main/morph/contracts/contracts/l1/staking/L1Staking.sol#L217-L246) function:

```javascript
function slash(uint256 sequencersBitmap) external onlyRollupContract nonReentrant returns (uint256) {
    address[] memory sequencers = getStakersFromBitmap(sequencersBitmap);
    uint256 valueSum;
    for (uint256 i = 0; i < sequencers.length; i++) {
        if (withdrawals[sequencers[i]] > 0) {
            delete withdrawals[sequencers[i]];
            valueSum += stakingValue;
    //..Omitted code
```

If a `sequencer` has a pending withdrawal, it will be removed as seen in this line:

```javascript
delete withdrawals[sequencers[i]];
```

Users can claim their withdrawal by invoking `claimWithdrawal`:

```javascript
function claimWithdrawal(address receiver) external nonReentrant {
    require(withdrawals[_msgSender()] > 0, "withdrawal not exist");
    require(withdrawals[_msgSender()] < block.number, "withdrawal locked");

    delete withdrawals[_msgSender()];
    _cleanStakerStore();

    emit Claimed(_msgSender(), receiver);

    _transfer(receiver, stakingValue);
}
```

Based on this logic, a user could execute the following steps:
- Bob is about to be slashed while having a pending withdrawal.
- His withdrawal request would be deleted when `slash` is called.
- To avoid this, Bob can frontrun the `slash` function by calling `claimWithdrawal` first.
- This allows him to quickly claim his withdrawal before the slash occurs.

### Recommendation
Prevent users from being able to frontrun slashing by quickly claiming their withdrawal
