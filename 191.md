# A staker can grief/dos the owner that calls revertBatches

## Summary

The owner can get DOSed/griefed when using revertBatch().

## Vulnerability Detail

[`Rollup.revertBatch()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-morphl2/blob/main/morph/contracts/contracts/l1/rollup/Rollup.sol#L326) is vulnerable to DOS attacks if the owner uses the exact `_count` needed to reach the end of the commited batches. Simply an active staker can commit a valid batch and make his call revert. Note: this can happen due to simple race conditions too.

Then the owner can then decide to increase the `_count` to mitigate this. By increasing the `_count` with 20 let's say, to be sure the call will pass. The staker can decide to commit 19 invalid batches right before the revertBatch call. This will make the owner pay more gas fees.

Even if these invalid batches get challenged before the revertBatch call this will not matter because `revertBatch()` will simply cancel them and the staker will not get slashed. The challenges (if any) will also slow down the finalization process of the protocol since all batches but the challenged ones will get their `finalizeTimestamp` increased by a `proofWindow`.

Of course, the staker will not be able to DOS the owner continuously only with valid batches as they will run out at some point. He can start doing this with invalid batches but then the owner can decide to remove him as a staker to prevent him from committing new batches and wait for the challenges to end before calling `revertBatch()` so the malicious staker gets slashed.

The process is not ideal because under normal circumstances the owner will get DOSed/griefed a couple of times before taking action against the staker. If he simply removes him as a staker and reverts the batches right away the staker will not be punished. 

On the other hand, if he removes him as a staker and waits for the challenge to end so challengers slash the staker he will not be able to prevent other stakers of committing new batches that have to be removed and again pay more gas. This is because `revertBatch()` is intended to be used after slashing to remove all batches after the invalid one. So all new batches that are committed after will have to be removed too.

## Impact
The owner can get DOSed/griefed without financial consequences (except gas fees) for the malicious staker.

Manual Review

## Recommendation

When a batch is proven to be invalid and the submitter gets slashed, make commitBatch() revert until the invalid batch and all batches after it are removed.
