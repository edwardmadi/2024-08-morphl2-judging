# Deposit transactions from EOAs can be burned by an attacker, leading to loss of funds

### Summary

Deposit transactions cannot be dropped if the original sender was an EOA. Because an attacker is able to (a) force deposit transactions to be skipped, and (b) waste all replays of another user's transactions, this gives an attacker the ability to burn any deposit transaction from an EOA, leading to a loss of funds for the depositing user.

### Root Cause

In `L1CrossDomainMessenger.sol`, the expected flow is that a user will call `sendMessage()`. If the message is skipped, they can call `replayMessage()` to try again (up to 3 times). At any point, they can call `dropMessage()`, and if the message has been skipped, they will receive a refund.

However, [the `dropMessage()` function calls `onDropMessage()` on the sender](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-morphl2/blob/main/morph/contracts/contracts/l1/L1CrossDomainMessenger.sol#L289). This means that if the sender is an EOA, the transaction will fail, as we cannot call functions on EOAs in high level Solidity. The result is that the failed transaction cannot be dropped and refunded.

This would be unfortunate on its own, but it is made worse by the fact that it can be forced by an attacker due to two issues:

1) Skipped transactions occur for many reasons, but the simplest is if the L2 block gas limit is hit (as we can see [here](https://github.com/morph-l2/go-ethereum/blob/e58ac01d16da31d9ca25a5e7e0e09bfdd352e76b/miner/pipeline.go#L276-L289)). This means that an attacker can frontrun a deposit with other deposits that use the full L2 block gas limit in order to force it to be skipped. (Note that this would normally be a bit expensive, but anyone can replay any historical deposit transaction from a whitelisted address at no cost, so we are actually able to do this for free.)

2) The `replayMessage()` function can be called by anyone, not just the original depositor. This means that an attacker can backrun the transaction in the same block to use up all of the `maxReplayTimes` attempts, as all of these replays will be skipped since the block gas limit has been hit.

The result is that any deposit from an EOA can be attacked in this way and the funds will be forever lost.

### Internal Preconditions

None

### External Preconditions

1. A user is making a deposit with ETH value from an EOA.

### Attack Path

1. A user is intended to make a deposit from their EOA for a large amount of ETH.
2. The attacker sees this transaction and frontruns it by calling `replayMessage()` with 3 previous transactions from a whitelisted address, setting the gas price to 10mm for each of them.
3. The original deposit transaction will fail because the L2 block is now full.
4. The attacker then calls `replayMessage()` 3 times with the depositor's transaction in the same block, using up all the replay attempts and ensuring that all the replays are skipped as well.

### Impact

The user attempting to deposit funds via the bridge loses all of the funds they attempted to deposit.

### PoC

The following test can be added to `L1CrossDomainMessenger.t.sol` to demonstrate that calling `dropMessage()` when the sender is an EOA will fail:

```solidity
function testPapa_dropFromEOAReverts() external {
    // send a cross chain message
    hevm.deal(bob, 2 ether);
    hevm.startPrank(bob);
    l1CrossDomainMessenger.sendMessage{value: 2 ether}(address(bob), 1 ether, "send message", 100_000);

    // set the first message (ours) to skipped
    hevm.startPrank(address(rollup));
    l1MessageQueueWithGasPriceOracle.popCrossDomainMessage(0, 1, 0x1);

    // drop message fails because the `onDropMessage()` function is called on an EOA
    hevm.expectRevert(bytes(""));
    l1CrossDomainMessenger.dropMessage(bob, bob, 1 ether, 0, "send message");
}
```

### Mitigation

Do not allow other users to call `replayMessage()` on behalf of the original depositor. This isn't a perfect solution, as the attacker could frontrun all the replays, but with the help of Flashbots Protect and some warnings to users, it would likely be sufficient (and is much easier than rearchitecting the deposit queue).
