# Initialization and state update issues

## Summary

## Vulnerability Detail
In the _claim function, the variables delegatorAmount and totalAmount are updated within the loop based on certain conditions. However, they may not be properly initialized during the first iteration. If amounts[delegator] or delegationAmount are zero during the first iteration and havenâ€™t been assigned values previously, the variables will remain zero, leading to issues in subsequent calculations.
## Impact
Uninitialized variables may lead to incorrect reward calculations, resulting in either excessive rewards or zero rewards.
an uninitialized totalAmount being zero could lead to a division by zero error.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Try initializing delegatorAmount and totalAmount before entering the loop
