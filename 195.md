# Structures with dynamic types are not correctly deleted

## Summary
In several places in the codebase an improper deletion of structs fails to clear the dynamic types stored within them. This can lead to unintended access to data that should have been removed, posing potential risks to the system's integrity.

[See solidity docs](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/develop/types.html#delete)

## Vulnerability Detail
### Gov.sol
```solidity
struct Set {
    bytes32[] _values;
    mapping(bytes32 => uint256) _indexes;
    }
...
struct AddressSet {
    Set _inner;
}
...
mapping(uint256 proposalID => EnumerableSetUpgradeable.AddressSet) internal votes;
```

In the function `_executeProposal#260`:
```solidity
delete votes[i];
```
What is wrong -  if we delete struct this way dynamic `_indexes` are not deleted. After deletion, we can simply access these dynamic types, as they are still present and relevant.

### Distribute.sol
```solidity
struct Distribution {
    uint256 delegatorRewardAmount;
    uint256 commissionAmount;
    uint256 delegationAmount;
    uint256 remainsNumber;
    EnumerableSetUpgradeable.AddressSet delegators;
    mapping(address delegator => uint256 amount) amounts;
}
```

In the function `claimCommission#235`:
```solidity
delete distributions[delegatee][i];
```

in the function `_claim#369`:
```solidity
delete distributions[delegatee][i];
```

What is wrong -  if we delete struct this way there are two things which remain in the storage : `delegators` and `amounts`.
After deletion, we can simply access these dynamic types, as they are still present and relevant. Following example will return the address:

```solidity
distributions[delegatee][i].amounts[delegator] 
```

## Impact
The functionality is meant to completely delete those structures. In case of Distribution data, all data after epoch end should be reseted, in case of Governance data, all data about older votes should be reseted.

The leftover data could pose a significant issue if unexpected scenarios arise where old indexes or votes are accessed. This could lead to serious problems, as outdated data would remain accessible. A an example of edge case scenario is epoch `0` before start of the reward. As it can stay zero for undefined time, in case of delegating and undelegating - storing data in epoch and later deleting them (incorrectly). Another delegation my lead to dangerous access of dynamic types that should have been wiped out.

Although no direct exploit has been identified, this behavior is not as intended, and the issue could become critical under specific circumstances. Therefore, addressing this now will prevent any potential problems in the future.

Wake detector

## Recommendation

Dynamic types have to manually deleted asi it is done in `notifyUndelegation` function

```solidity
distributions[delegatee][effectiveEpoch].delegators.remove(delegator);
delete distributions[delegatee][effectiveEpoch].amounts[delegator];
```
