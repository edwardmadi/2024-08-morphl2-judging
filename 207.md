# Malicious staker might have an opportunity to escape without getting slashed

## Summary

Malicious staker might have an opportunity to escape without getting slashed if the Ethereum block production speed changes in the future.

## Vulnerability Detail

For a staker to claim his stake when he exits the system he needs to wait `withdrawalLockBlocks` before doing so. This is done to prevent malicious stakers from leaving the system before getting penalized if they misbehave.

The current parameters presented in a doc by the protocol are:

L1Staking.withdrawalLockBlocks == 7 days worth of blocks
Rollup.proofWindow == 2 days
Rollup.finalizationPeriodSeconds == 1 day

To prevent the staker from escaping, the `withdrawalLockBlocks` will have to hold him long enough for his invalid batch to get challenged and him to get slashed.

1. He commits invalid batch and calls [`withdraw()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-morphl2/blob/main/morph/contracts/contracts/l1/staking/L1Staking.sol#L197) right after.
2. Then the challenge needs to be submitted within a day (before the batch can be finalized).
3. Let's assume the best case scenario (for the attacker) the challenge starts right before that day is finished.
4. New 2 days are needed for the attacker to get slashed.
5. In total with the current settings the attacker has 3 days to escape.

The `withdrawalLockBlocks` are 7 days worth of blocks but having number of blocks instead of using timestamp for measuring long periods is not safe since the block production rate of blockchains change.

Since there are no mechanisms mentioned that will keep track of the L1 block production rate that could signal when the `withdrawalLockBlocks` should be updated we can assume that there can be a window of time in which `withdrawalLockBlocks` is not going to be updated.

If the block production rate changes and Ethereum starts producing blocks 2 times faster then `withdrawalLockBlocks` which represents 7 days worth of blocks will now be 3.5 days. If block production increases 3 times then the time is going to be 2.3 days.

Timestamp can be manipulated but to only a couple of seconds. For long periods using timestamp is the safer approach.

## Impact

Malicious staker might have an opportunity to escape without getting slashed.
