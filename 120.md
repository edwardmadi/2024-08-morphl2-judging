# funds cab be  locked in the contract.

## Summary
The receive function allows the owner to send Ether to the contract but does not provide a mechanism to withdraw it.
## Vulnerability Detail

  function __Messenger_init(address _counterpart, address _feeVault) internal onlyInitializing {
        OwnableUpgradeable.__Ownable_init();
        PausableUpgradeable.__Pausable_init();
        ReentrancyGuardUpgradeable.__ReentrancyGuard_init();

        // initialize to a nonzero value
        xDomainMessageSender = Constants.DEFAULT_XDOMAIN_MESSAGE_SENDER;

        counterpart = _counterpart;
        if (_feeVault != address(0)) {
            feeVault = _feeVault;
        }
    }

    /* solhint-enable */

    // make sure only owner can send ether to messenger to avoid possible user fund loss.
  @>>  receive() external payable onlyOwner {}
