# Edge case scenario in Gov.sol leading to execution of incorrect proposal

## Vulnerability Detail

### Scenario:
1. Sequencer creates a proposal `A`. Sequencer votes. `_checkPassed()` does not pass instantly. 
2. No problem, the proposal `A` can be executed later by calling `executeProposal()` but before expiration. [say 5 days]
3. Sequencer realizes it is an incorrect proposal so it decides to create a new proposal. The previous one will be deleted after execution of the current one.
4. However in the middle of this, the Owner **decreases** the `votingDuration`. [From 5 days to 2 days]
5. Sequencer creates a new proposal `B` but the expiration of the new one will is less than that of proposal `A`.
6. The sequencer votes but it does not pass instantly. 
7. No problem, the proposal `B` can be executed later by calling `executeProposal()` but before expiration. [2 days]
8. Now `updateSequencerSet()` in Sequencer.sol is called with a net set of values.
9. No one calls `executeProposal()` for proposal `B` & it has expired.
10. Meanwhile proposal `A` has still not expired.
11. Someone calls `executeProposal()` with id of proposal `A`, the checks pass because of the new set of values & all the parameters are updated with incorrect values.

The solution would be to create a different proposal & execute it but still atleast for sometime the parameters would have incorrect values. 

## Impact
Chances of incorrect proposal being passed.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Make sure that there isn't any proposal in queue when the voting duration is changed.
