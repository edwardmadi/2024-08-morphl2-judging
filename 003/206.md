# Sequencer will be not be updated thereby the sequencer set will be containing stale values resulting in proposals not being passed correctly

## Vulnerability Detail
According to the function, the sequencer is updated only when `(stakerRankings[remove[i]] <= latestSequencerSetSize)` is `true`.

```solidity
File: L2Staking.sol

    function removeStakers(address[] calldata remove) external onlyOtherStaking {
        bool updateSequencerSet = false;
        for (uint256 i = 0; i < remove.length; i++) {     
            if (stakerRankings[remove[i]] <= latestSequencerSetSize) { 
 >              updateSequencerSet = true;
            }
           ...
            delete stakers[remove[i]];
        }
        emit StakerRemoved(remove);

 >      if (updateSequencerSet) {
            _updateSequencerSet();
        }
    }
```
### Scenario
- Reward distribution hasn't started & suppose "`latestSequencerSetSize` == `sequencerSetMaxSize` == `5`"
- The current number of stakers is `8` (because there is no limit to the number of stakers that can be added).
- All the `8` stakers have delegated at this point. Therefore the `candidateNumber` is now `8`.

```solidity
File: L2Staking.sol

   function delegateStake(address delegatee, uint256 amount) external isStaker(delegatee) nonReentrant {
        ...
        if (stakerDelegations[delegatee] == amount) {
            candidateNumber += 1;
        }
        ...
```
- Owner calls `updateSequencerSetMaxSize()` & increases the `sequencerSetMaxSize` to `10`. The sequencer won't be updated because of the check.
```solidity

function updateSequencerSetMaxSize(uint256 _sequencerSetMaxSize) external onlyOwner {
       ...
        sequencerSetMaxSize = _sequencerSetMaxSize;
        emit SequencerSetMaxSizeUpdated(_oldSequencerSetMaxSize, _sequencerSetMaxSize);

>       if (sequencerSetMaxSize < latestSequencerSetSize) {
            // update sequencer set
            _updateSequencerSet();
        }
```
- `removeStakers()` is now called & some of the recent added stakers are being removed. Lets say that the last two stakers are being removed.
- Since the `stakerRankings` of those stakers are `7` & `8` which is greater than `latestSequencerSetSize` (`5`), the `updateSequencerSet` will se be `false` & thus `_updateSequencerSet()` will not be called.

```solidity
File: L2Staking.sol

   function removeStakers(address[] calldata remove) external onlyOtherStaking {
        bool updateSequencerSet = false;
        for (uint256 i = 0; i < remove.length; i++) {
>           if (stakerRankings[remove[i]] <= latestSequencerSetSize) {   
>               updateSequencerSet = true;
            }
         ...
 >      if (updateSequencerSet) {
            _updateSequencerSet();
        }
```
## Impact

This might result in a proposals not being passed when the call reaches the `_checkPassed()` inside `Gov.sol` contract because the sequencer hasn't been updated with the recent changes that took place in the `L2Staking.sol` contract.

```solidity
File: Gov.sol

   function _checkPassed(uint256 proposalID) internal view returns (bool) {
        // checking invalidate votes
>       address[] memory latestSequencerSet = ISequencer(SEQUENCER_CONTRACT).getSequencerSet2();
        uint256 validVotes = 0;
        for (uint256 i = 0; i < latestSequencerSet.length; i++) {
            if (votes[proposalID].contains(latestSequencerSet[i])) {
                validVotes = validVotes + 1;
            }
        }
        return validVotes > (latestSequencerSet.length * 2) / 3;
    }
```

## Recommendation
Update sequencers whenever `updateSequencerSetMaxSize()` is called.
