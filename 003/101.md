# `latestSequencerSetSize` can be larger than `sequencerSetMaxSize`

### Summary

The `L2Staking.sol` contract can be initialized with a list of stakers that is longer than the `sequencersMaxSize`, which causes the contract to act in unexpected ways.

### Root Cause

In `L2Staking.sol`, the initial list of stakers is added by [passing an array into the `initialize()` function](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-morphl2/blob/main/morph/contracts/contracts/l2/staking/L2Staking.sol#L141).
```solidity
function initialize(
    address _owner,
    uint256 _sequencersMaxSize,
    uint256 _undelegateLockEpochs,
    uint256 _rewardStartTime,
    Types.StakerInfo[] calldata _stakers
) public initializer {
    require(_owner != address(0), "invalid owner address");
    require(_sequencersMaxSize > 0, "sequencersSize must greater than 0");
    require(_undelegateLockEpochs > 0, "invalid undelegateLockEpochs");
    require(
        _rewardStartTime > block.timestamp && _rewardStartTime % REWARD_EPOCH == 0,
        "invalid reward start time"
    );
    require(_stakers.length > 0, "invalid initial stakers");

    ...

    sequencerSetMaxSize = _sequencersMaxSize;
    latestSequencerSetSize = _stakers.length;

    for (uint256 i = 0; i < latestSequencerSetSize; i++) {
        stakers[_stakers[i].addr] = _stakers[i];
        stakerAddresses.push(_stakers[i].addr);
        stakerRankings[_stakers[i].addr] = i + 1;
    }

    ...
}
```
While `sequencerSetMaxSize` is set (and enforced for all other operations), there is no check to ensure that `stakers.length <= sequencerSetMaxSize`.

If such such a list of stakers is passed, the function will set `latestSequencerSetSize > sequencerSetMaxSize`, which is not a position the contract should ever be in.

This has a few important implications, the most clear being that all future stakers added will not cause the sequencer set to be updated:
```solidity
function addStaker(Types.StakerInfo calldata add) external onlyOtherStaking {
    ...

    if (!rewardStarted && stakerAddresses.length <= sequencerSetMaxSize) {
        _updateSequencerSet();
    }
}
```
As a result, this incorrect ordering will not be resolved until `startRewards()` is called later.

### Internal Preconditions

1. The caller of `initialize()` must pass a list of stakers that is larger than `sequencerSetMaxSize`.

### External Preconditions

None

### Attack Path

N/A

### Impact

The `latestSequencerSetSize` can be set larger than `sequencerSetMaxSize`, which shoudl not be possible, and leads the tracking of stakers to misbehave.

### PoC

N/A

### Mitigation

Add a check to ensure that `stakers.length <= sequencerSetMaxSize` in the `initialize()` function.
