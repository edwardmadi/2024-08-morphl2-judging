# The value of latestSequencerSetSize may exceed sequencerSetMaxSize

### Summary

In L2Staking.sol, the variable `latestSequencerSetSize` represents the current size of the sequencer set, while `sequencerSetMaxSize` defines its maximum allowable size. Therefore, it's essential to always maintain the condition `latestSequencerSetSize <= sequencerSetMaxSize`.

However, in the `initialize` function of L2Staking.sol, `_stakers.length` is assigned directly to `latestSequencerSetSize` without validating that `_stakers.length <= sequencerSetMaxSize`. This allows the caller of the `initialize` function to pass an array of stakers with any length. If the array length exceeds `sequencerSetMaxSize`, it would result in a misalignment between `sequencerSetMaxSize` and `latestSequencerSetSize`, potentially leading to unintended behavior.

### Root Cause

In L2Staking.sol, function `initialize` misses a check for `latestSequencerSetSize <= sequencerSetMaxSize`.
