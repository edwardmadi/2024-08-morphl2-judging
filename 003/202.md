# `updateSequencerSetMaxSize()` should update sequencer set even when `_sequencerSetMaxSize` is greater than it was previously

## Summary
`updateSequencerSetMaxSize()` should update sequencer set even when `_sequencerSetMaxSize` is greater than it was previously

## Vulnerability Detail
Currently, in [`updateSequencerSetMaxSize()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-morphl2/blob/98e0ec4c5bbd0b28f3d3a9e9159d1184bc45b38d/morph/contracts/contracts/l2/staking/L2Staking.sol#L221) the sequencer set is only updated if `sequencerSetMaxSize < latestSequencerSetSize` :

```solidity
    function updateSequencerSetMaxSize(uint256 _sequencerSetMaxSize) external onlyOwner {
        require(
            _sequencerSetMaxSize > 0 && _sequencerSetMaxSize != sequencerSetMaxSize,
            "invalid new sequencer set max size"
        );
        uint256 _oldSequencerSetMaxSize = sequencerSetMaxSize;
        sequencerSetMaxSize = _sequencerSetMaxSize;
        emit SequencerSetMaxSizeUpdated(_oldSequencerSetMaxSize, _sequencerSetMaxSize);

        if (sequencerSetMaxSize < latestSequencerSetSize) {
            // update sequencer set
            _updateSequencerSet();
        }
    }
```

```solidity
    function _updateSequencerSet() internal {
        uint256 sequencerSize = sequencerSetMaxSize;
        if (rewardStarted) {
            if (candidateNumber < sequencerSetMaxSize) {
                sequencerSize = candidateNumber;
            }
        } else if (stakerAddresses.length < sequencerSetMaxSize) {
            sequencerSize = stakerAddresses.length;
        }
        address[] memory sequencerSet = new address[](sequencerSize);
        for (uint256 i = 0; i < sequencerSize; i++) {
            sequencerSet[i] = stakerAddresses[i];
        }
        ISequencer(SEQUENCER_CONTRACT).updateSequencerSet(sequencerSet);
        latestSequencerSetSize = sequencerSet.length;
    }
```

This logic is incorrect. If there are enough candidates, then if the `sequencerSetMaxSize` is increased, the sequencer set will still remain the old size. This means that the sequencers won't receive commissions or be able to part-take in `Gov.sol` operations until the sequencer set is updated through delegations or undelegations until the `updateSequencerSet()` conditions are met in those functions.
