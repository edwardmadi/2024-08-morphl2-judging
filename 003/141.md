# Updating the max sequencer set size does not immediately update the sequencer set

### Summary

Updating the max sequencer set size does not immediately update the sequencer set

### Root Cause

When the `sequencerSetMaxSize` is increased, the sequencer set is not immediately updated

[L2Staking.sol#L218-L233](https://github.com/morph-l2/morph/blob/main/contracts/contracts/l2/staking/L2Staking.sol#L218-L233)
```solidity
    /// @notice update params
    /// @param _sequencerSetMaxSize   max size of sequencer set
    function updateSequencerSetMaxSize(uint256 _sequencerSetMaxSize) external onlyOwner {
        require(
            _sequencerSetMaxSize > 0 && _sequencerSetMaxSize != sequencerSetMaxSize,
            "invalid new sequencer set max size"
        );
        uint256 _oldSequencerSetMaxSize = sequencerSetMaxSize;
        sequencerSetMaxSize = _sequencerSetMaxSize;
        emit SequencerSetMaxSizeUpdated(_oldSequencerSetMaxSize, _sequencerSetMaxSize);

        if (sequencerSetMaxSize < latestSequencerSetSize) {
            // update sequencer set
            _updateSequencerSet();
        }
    }
```
The `latestSequencerSetSize` is always `<=` to the `sequencerSetMaxSize`, as such when the `sequencerSetMaxSize` is increased, it is always false that `sequencerSetMaxSize < latestSequencerSetSize` and the sequencer set will not be updated.
