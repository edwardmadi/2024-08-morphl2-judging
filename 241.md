# calculateIntrinsicGasFee() method in L1messagequeuewithgaspriceoracle.sol will always overestimate the gas-price thus inflating the bridging cost for the users

### Summary

`calculateIntrinsicGasFee()` in `L1messagequeuewithgaspriceoracle` is always overestimating the gas price for the bridging due to inflated bytes price count thus leading to high gas-price estimation of the users

### Root Cause

```sol
    function calculateIntrinsicGasFee(bytes calldata _calldata) public pure virtual returns (uint256) {
        // no way this can overflow `uint256`
        unchecked {
            return INTRINSIC_GAS_TX + _calldata.length * APPROPRIATE_INTRINSIC_GAS_PER_BYTE;
        }
    }
```
In the following snippet, the `APPROPRIATE_INTRINSIC_GAS_PER_BYTE` variable is always 16 which is wrong. According to intrinsic value calculation, there is an overestimation of the gas fees as we are not taking zero-bytes into consideration which has much less-significant gas cost of 4 gas per byte which thus leads to estimation of the gas price of the users

### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

This can lead to high level gas overestimation for the bridging price which is then charged from the users

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

The following mitigation steps can be taken for more accurate gas-estimation

- Access the calldata
-Iterate over each byte in the calldata.
- Count zero and non-zero bytes by checking if a byte equals 0x00 (zero-byte) or not (non-zero byte).
