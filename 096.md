# MorphToken cannot mint new tokens due to improper initialization

### Summary

When the `MorphToken.sol` contract is deployed on L2 genesis, some of its storage values (including the `dailyInflationRate_`) are not set properly. Because of assumptions in the `updateRate()` and `mintInflations()` functions, this means that the contract will be permanently blocked from updating its inflation rate or minting new inflation tokens.

### Root Cause

`MorphToken.sol` uses its [`initialize()` function](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-morphl2/blob/main/morph/contracts/contracts/l2/system/MorphToken.sol#L82-L96) to set a number of important parameters:

```solidity
function initialize(
    string memory name_,
    string memory symbol_,
    address _owner,
    uint256 initialSupply_,
    uint256 dailyInflationRate_
) public initializer {
    _name = name_;
    _symbol = symbol_;
    _mint(_owner, initialSupply_);
    _epochInflationRates.push(EpochInflationRate(dailyInflationRate_, 0));
    _transferOwnership(_owner);

    emit UpdateEpochInflationRate(dailyInflationRate_, 0);
}
```
Notably, the `dailyInflationRate_` is set in this function. If this is not set, it can never be updated later, because the `updateRate()` function loads the previous rate, which requires there to be at least one rate set:
```solidity
function updateRate(uint256 newRate, uint256 effectiveEpochIndex) public onlyOwner {
    require(
        _epochInflationRates[_epochInflationRates.length - 1].rate != newRate,
        "new rate is the same as the latest rate"
    );
    ...
}
```
A similar assumption (taking `_epochInflationRates.length - 1`) is made in the `mintInflations()` function, which is called to mint new inflation tokens.

It turns out that in the deployment of this contract, the `initialize()` function is locked, but the values are never set. We can see this in `ops/l2-genesis/morph-chain-ops/genesis/config.go`, where it sets the storage values for all contracts. Specifically, we can see where the MorphToken is set:
```go
storage["MorphToken"] = state.StorageValues{
	"_initialized":  1,
	"_initializing": false,
}
```
This will set the value of `_initialized` to `1`, blocking future calls to `initialize()`. But it will not set the `dailyInflationRate_` value, which means that the `updateRate()` function, as well as all calls to `mintInflations()`, will always fail.

### Internal Preconditions

None

### External Preconditions

None

### Attack Path

N/A

### Impact

The `MorphToken.sol` contract will be functionally useless, as it won't be able to update its inflation rate or mint new inflation tokens for sequencer rewards.

### PoC

N/A

### Mitigation

All the storage values should be set properly in the genesis file.

Additionally, for safety, `updateRate()` can be adjusted to only perform its checks in the event that `_epochInflationRates.length > 0`.
