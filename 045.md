# Sequencer set can be updated incorrectly

### Summary

The missing check for `stakerRankings` to determine whether it is "0" in [L2Staking.sol:176-178](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-morphl2/blob/98e0ec4c5bbd0b28f3d3a9e9159d1184bc45b38d/morph/contracts/contracts/l2/staking/L2Staking.sol#L176-L178) will unnecessarily update the sequencer set in `Sequencer.sol`, which will result in incorrect sequencer sets in `Sequencer.sol`.

### Root Cause


When a staker calls the internal function [L1Staking.sol::removeStaker()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-morphl2/blob/98e0ec4c5bbd0b28f3d3a9e9159d1184bc45b38d/morph/contracts/contracts/l1/staking/L1Staking.sol#L178-L194), the `_msgRemoveStakers` function is executed, sending a message to L2 to inform that the sequencer is removed.

After the staker is removed, the same staker can still be removed from L2 if they are slashed and the slashed sequencer is that same sequencer. Since the L2 sequencer is already removed, or will be removed again, when [L2Staking.sol::removeStakers()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-morphl2/blob/98e0ec4c5bbd0b28f3d3a9e9159d1184bc45b38d/morph/contracts/contracts/l2/staking/L2Staking.sol#L173) is called for the second time, the `stakerRankings` will be "0." Therefore, [this check](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-morphl2/blob/98e0ec4c5bbd0b28f3d3a9e9159d1184bc45b38d/morph/contracts/contracts/l2/staking/L2Staking.sol#L176-L178) will always pass, unnecessarily updating the sequencer set, even though it shouldn't be updated because the sequencer was already removed during the first removal. This extra, unnecessary update of sequencers will modify the `sequencerSets` inside [Sequencer.sol:86](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-morphl2/blob/98e0ec4c5bbd0b28f3d3a9e9159d1184bc45b38d/morph/contracts/contracts/l2/staking/Sequencer.sol#L86-L111).

### Internal pre-conditions

1. Staker gets removed in L1 or withdraws its stake which sends the `removeStakers` message to L2
2. Staker gets slashed and an another `removeStakers` message is sent to L2

### External pre-conditions

none needed

### Attack Path

Same as the internal pre-conditions. As long as the pre-conditions are met then the bug will exist without any additional change 

### Impact

The `Sequencer.sol` contract is responsible for storing data related to the `sequencerSet`. The L2 node reads the real-time changes in the contract to update the `sequencerSet` of the consensus layer. As a result, an incorrect update to the `sequencerSet` will alter the sequencer sets stored inside `Sequencer.sol`, leading to inaccurate sequencer sets being maintained in `Sequencer.sol`.

### PoC

None needed

### Mitigation

add the `stakerRankings[remove[i]] != 0` check to L2Staking.sol:176-178:

```solidity
if (stakerRankings[remove[i]] <= latestSequencerSetSize && stakerRankings[remove[i]] != 0) {
                updateSequencerSet = true;
 }
```
