# wrong implement of dropMessage

## Summary
wrong implement of dropMessage that can cause infinite loop
## Vulnerability Detail
Here we can that prevReplayIndex[x]  cannot be zero as mention down.
 @notice Mapping from queue index to previous replay queue index.
    ///
    /// @dev If a message `x` was replayed 3 times with index `q1`, `q2` and `q3`, the
    /// value of `prevReplayIndex` and `replayStates` will be `replayStates[hash(x)].lastIndex = q3`,
    /// `replayStates[hash(x)].times = 3`, `prevReplayIndex[q3] = q2`, `prevReplayIndex[q2] = q1`,
    /// `prevReplayIndex[q1] = x` and `prevReplayIndex[x]=nil`.
    ///
    /// @dev The index `x` that `prevReplayIndex[x]=nil` is used as the termination of the list.
    /// Usually we use `0` to represent `nil`, but we cannot distinguish it with the first message
 @>>   /// with index zero. So a nonzero offset `1` is added to the value of `prevReplayIndex[x]` to
    /// avoid such situation.
    mapping(uint256 => uint256) public prevReplayIndex;


Here we are checking the prevReplayIndex[x] ==0 then we are doing the break of while loop.


  // @note If the list is very long, the message may never be dropped.
        while (true) {
            IL1MessageQueue(_messageQueue).dropCrossDomainMessage(_lastIndex);
            _lastIndex = prevReplayIndex[_lastIndex];
     @>>       if (_lastIndex == 0) break;
            unchecked {
                _lastIndex = _lastIndex - 1;
            }
        }

## Impact
Infinite loop can happen in dropMessage which can cause out of gas.
