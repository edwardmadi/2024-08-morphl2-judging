# `L1USDCGateway.sol::burnAllLockedUSDC` will not work since the gateway is not a `minter` in the `USDC` contract

### Summary

The function `L1USDCGateway.sol::burnAllLockedUSDC` is supposed to allow the `circle` caller to burn all bridged `USDC` tokens. This is done by calling `burn` on the `USDC` token. However this will not succeed since the `USDC.burn` can only be called by `minters` which the gateway is not.


### Root Cause

The problem is the assumption that the [`L1USDCGateway`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-morphl2/blob/98e0ec4c5bbd0b28f3d3a9e9159d1184bc45b38d/morph/contracts/contracts/l1/gateways/usdc/L1USDCGateway.sol#L88-L96) can call the `burn` function of the `USDC` contract which is not the case if we look at the code of the `USDC` contract.

```solidity
function burn(uint256 _amount) whenNotPaused onlyMinters notBlacklisted(msg.sender) public {
    uint256 balance = balances[msg.sender];
    require(_amount > 0);
    require(balance >= _amount);

    totalSupply_ = totalSupply_.sub(_amount);
    balances[msg.sender] = balance.sub(_amount);
    emit Burn(msg.sender, _amount);
    emit Transfer(msg.sender, address(0), _amount);
}
```

We see that it has the `onlyMinters` modifier.

### Internal pre-conditions

None

### External pre-conditions

None

### Attack Path

This has no attack path as it is just broken functionality. If the circle caller tries to call `burnAllLockedUSDC`, that will just fail.

### Impact

Broken core functionality
