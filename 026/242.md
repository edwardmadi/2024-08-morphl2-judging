# Index errors in pagination function

## Summary
In the getAllDelegatorsInPagination function, there is an array index error that may lead to an array out-of-bounds issue.
## Vulnerability Detail
When the pageIndex is greater than 0, the start variable might be greater than 0, but the index of delegatorsInPage starts at 0, which may result in out-of-bounds access when referencing delegatorsInPage[i].
The size of delegatorsInPage is fixed at pageSize, but the actual number of returned elements could be fewer than pageSize.

## Impact
Array Out-of-Bounds Access: This could lead to a transaction rollback, preventing users from retrieving paginated data.
Data Inconsistency: The length of the returned array may not match the actual data filled, potentially causing display issues on the front end.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Initialize the size of delegatorsInPage based on the actual number of elements to be returned, and ensure the index is handled correctly.
