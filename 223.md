# The arbitrary calls in the cross-comain messengers allow anyone to drain them

### Summary

Both cross-comain messengers can be drained due to them making arbitrary calls.


### Root Cause

Any user can send messages from `L1 -> L2` and vice-versa, on L2 these messages are executed by the `L2CrossDomainMessenger`, in the [`_executeMessage`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-morphl2/blob/98e0ec4c5bbd0b28f3d3a9e9159d1184bc45b38d/morph/contracts/contracts/l2/L2CrossDomainMessenger.sol#L141) function. There the message is passed to a `call` with a destination which is only restricted to not be `address(this)` or `L2_TO_L1_MESSAGE_PASSER`.

```solidity
function _executeMessage(
    address _from,
    address _to,
    uint256 _value,
    bytes memory _message,
    bytes32 _xDomainCalldataHash
) internal {
    // [...]
    (bool success, ) = _to.call{value: _value}(_message);
    // [...]
}
```

In the `L1CrossDomainMessenger`, the arbitrary call is made in [`proveAndRelayMessage`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-morphl2/blob/98e0ec4c5bbd0b28f3d3a9e9159d1184bc45b38d/morph/contracts/contracts/l1/L1CrossDomainMessenger.sol#L161).

```solidity
function proveAndRelayMessage(
    address _from,
    address _to,
    uint256 _value,
    uint256 _nonce,
    bytes memory _message,
    bytes32[32] calldata _withdrawalProof,
    bytes32 _withdrawalRoot
) external override whenNotPaused notInExecution {
    // [...]
    (bool success, ) = _to.call{value: _value}(_message);
    // [...]
}
```

### Internal pre-conditions

None

### External pre-conditions

None

### Attack Path

* User makes cross-chain call from `L1 -> L2` or `L2 -> L1`, specifying a message by encoding for example `token.approve(address(attacker), type(uint256.max))`
* This will then be executed by the either the L1 or L2 messenger
* User can now transfer tokens out of the messenger


### Impact

Attacker can drain all funds from both messengers.
