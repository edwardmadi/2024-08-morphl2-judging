# Owner's ability to remove a staker can be DOS'ed

### Description
The `onlyOwner` can remove a staker by calling the [`removeStaker`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-morphl2/blob/main/morph/contracts/contracts/l1/staking/L1Staking.sol#L178-L194) function:

```javascript
function removeStaker(address[] memory _stakers) external onlyOwner {
    for (uint256 i = 0; i < _stakers.length; i++) {
        require(isActiveStaker(_stakers[i]), "only active staker can be removed");
        require(withdrawals[_stakers[i]] == 0, "withdrawing");

        withdrawals[_stakers[i]] = block.number + withdrawalLockBlocks;
        _removeStaker(_stakers[i]);
        emit Withdrawn(_stakers[i], withdrawals[_stakers[i]]);

        delete whitelist[_stakers[i]];
        removedList[_stakers[i]] = true;
    }
    emit StakersRemoved(_stakers);

    // send message to remove stakers on L2
    _msgRemoveStakers(_stakers);
}
```

One condition that must be satisfied is that the `staker` should not have an active withdrawal request:

```javascript
require(withdrawals[_stakers[i]] == 0, "withdrawing");
```

When a staker initiates a withdrawal, they do so by calling `withdraw`, which creates a new withdrawal request:

```javascript
function withdraw() external {
    require(isActiveStaker(_msgSender()), "only active staker");
    require(withdrawals[_msgSender()] == 0, "withdrawing");

    withdrawals[_msgSender()] = block.number + withdrawalLockBlocks;
    //..Omitted code
}
```

This withdrawal request will only be removed when the user calls `claimWithdrawal`, which only the `msg.sender` can execute:

```javascript
function claimWithdrawal(address receiver) external nonReentrant {
    require(withdrawals[_msgSender()] > 0, "withdrawal not exist");
    require(withdrawals[_msgSender()] < block.number, "withdrawal locked");

    delete withdrawals[_msgSender()];
    _cleanStakerStore();

    emit Claimed(_msgSender(), receiver);

    _transfer(receiver, stakingValue);
}
```

a staker can prevent `removeStaker` from ever being called by doing the following:

-  Bob initiates a withdrawal by calling `withdraw`, locking in a withdrawal request (even for a small amount).
-  Bob deliberately avoids finalising the withdrawal by never calling `claimWithdrawal`.
-  When the `onlyOwner` attempts to remove Bob by calling `removeStaker`, the operation fails due to this condition:
    ```javascript
    require(withdrawals[_stakers[i]] == 0, "withdrawing");
    ```
-  Since only Bob can call `claimWithdrawal`, no one can force him to complete the process.

 As a result, Bob cannot be removed by calling `removeStaker`.

### Recommendation
allow the `onlyOwner` to forcefully call `claimWithdrawal` for users, alternativaly, come up with some other logic.
