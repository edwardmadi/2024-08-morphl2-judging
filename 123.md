# Inconsistent State and Fund Locking Risk in L1TxFeeVault's `updateReceiveAllowed` Function

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-morphl2/blob/98e0ec4c5bbd0b28f3d3a9e9159d1184bc45b38d/morph/contracts/contracts/l2/system/L2TxFeeVault.sol#L210

```solidity
function updateReceiveAllowed(address[] memory _accounts, bool _status) external onlyOwner {
    for (uint256 i = 0; i < _accounts.length; i++) {
        require(_accounts[i] != address(0), "FeeVault: address cannot be address(0)");
        receiveAllowed[_accounts[i]] = _status;
        emit UpdateReceiveAllowed(_accounts[i], _status);
    }
}
```

The vulnerability is that the `updateReceiveAllowed` function doesn't handle the scenario where an account's receive status is changed while there are pending cross-domain messages or operations involving that account.

#### Here's why this is problematic:

1. The L1TxFeeVault is part of a cross-domain messaging system between L1 and L2.

2. There could be pending withdrawals or other operations that were initiated when an account was allowed to receive funds.

3. If the receive status is changed before these pending operations are processed, it could lead to an inconsistent state between L1 and L2.

4. If an account's receive status is set to false while there are pending incoming transfers, those funds could become locked or the transactions could fail unexpectedly.

5. An attacker could potentially exploit this to disrupt the expected flow of funds or cause issues with cross-domain operations.

This vulnerability arises from the fact that the function doesn't consider the temporal aspect of cross-domain operations and how changing the receive status might impact in-flight or pending transactions.

#### Impact:

The vulnerability in the `updateReceiveAllowed` function can lead to a situation where funds are permanently locked in the L1TxFeeVault contract. This is because the function allows changing the receive status of an account without considering pending cross-domain messages or the current balance of the contract.

#### Proof of Concept:

1. Initial state:
   - Account A is allowed to receive funds (receiveAllowed[A] = true)
   - L1TxFeeVault has a balance of 10 ETH

2. A cross-domain message is initiated from L2 to L1, requesting to transfer 5 ETH to Account A.

3. Before the cross-domain message is processed on L1, the owner calls `updateReceiveAllowed([A], false)`, setting receiveAllowed[A] to false.

4. The cross-domain message is now processed on L1:
   - It calls the `transferTo` function in L1TxFeeVault
   - `transferTo` checks `isReceiveAllowed(A)`, which now returns false
   - The transfer fails due to "FeeVault: recipient address not allowed"

5. Result:
   - The 5 ETH intended for Account A remains in the L1TxFeeVault
   - There's no mechanism to retry the transfer or update the destination

6. If this scenario repeats, more and more funds can get locked in the contract.

This vulnerability is particularly severe because:

1. Cross-domain messaging is asynchronous, creating a time window for this issue to occur.
2. The L1TxFeeVault doesn't have a mechanism to handle failed transfers or retry them.
3. There's no way to forcibly withdraw funds once they're locked in the contract.

The root cause is that the system doesn't maintain atomicity between initiating a cross-domain transfer and completing it. The `updateReceiveAllowed` function can interrupt this process midway, leading to an inconsistent state.

To fix this, the system should:
1. Implement a queue or pending transfers mechanism.
2. Only apply `receiveAllowed` changes after processing all pending transfers.
3. Add a way to handle failed transfers, possibly returning them to a default address or allowing manual intervention.
