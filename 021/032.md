# Attackers can exhaust the sequencer's resources at no cost.

### Summary

Since L1Staking is on the whitelist, messages sent through L1Staking will not incur fees. Attackers can exploit this mechanism to replay all transactions sent through L1Staking, wasting the sequencer's resources without paying any fees.

### Root Cause

A fee will be charged when sending a message, and the payment method is ETH. If `_from` is on the whitelist, the fee is 0.

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-morphl2/blob/main/morph/contracts/contracts/l1/L1CrossDomainMessenger.sol#L337-L338
```solidity
        // compute and deduct the messaging fee to fee vault.
        uint256 _fee = IL1MessageQueue(_messageQueue).estimateCrossDomainMessageFee(_msgSender(), _gasLimit);
``` 

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-morphl2/blob/main/morph/contracts/contracts/l1/rollup/L1MessageQueueWithGasPriceOracle.sol#L111-L117
```solidity
    function estimateCrossDomainMessageFee(address _sender, uint256 _gasLimit) external view returns (uint256) {
        // GasFee is waived for whitelisted users
        if (IWhitelist(whitelistChecker).isSenderAllowed(_sender)) {
            return 0;
        }
        return _gasLimit * l2BaseFee;
    }
``` 

There is no ETH sent where `L1Staking` calls `sendMessage`, which means that messages sent through `L1Staking` are free of charge. `L1Staking` is on the whitelist, which can also be seen in the deploy files.

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-morphl2/blob/main/morph/contracts/contracts/l1/staking/L1Staking.sol#L465-L472
```solidity
    function _msgAddStaker(Types.StakerInfo memory add) internal {
        MESSENGER.sendMessage(
            address(OTHER_STAKING),
            0,
            abi.encodeCall(IL2Staking.addStaker, (add)),
            gasLimitAddStaker
        );
    }
``` 

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-morphl2/blob/main/morph/contracts/deploy/020-ContractInit.ts#L37-L38
```solidity
        let addList = [L1StakingProxyAddress]
        res = await WhitelistCheckerImpl.updateWhitelistStatus(addList, true)
``` 

Anyone can replay undropped messages and be charged according to the message's `from` and `gasLimit`.

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-morphl2/blob/main/morph/contracts/contracts/l1/L1CrossDomainMessenger.sol#L175-L193
```solidity
    function replayMessage(
        address _from,
        address _to,
        uint256 _value,
        uint256 _messageNonce,
        bytes memory _message,
        uint32 _newGasLimit,
        address _refundAddress
    ) external payable override whenNotPaused notInExecution {
        // We will use a different `queueIndex` for the replaced message. However, the original `queueIndex` or `nonce`
        // is encoded in the `_message`. We will check the `xDomainCalldata` on layer 2 to avoid duplicated execution.
        // So, only one message will succeed on layer 2. If one of the message is executed successfully, the other one
        // will revert with "Message was already successfully executed".
        address _messageQueue = messageQueue;
        address _counterpart = counterpart;
        bytes memory _xDomainCalldata = _encodeXDomainCalldata(_from, _to, _value, _messageNonce, _message);
        bytes32 _xDomainCalldataHash = keccak256(_xDomainCalldata);

        require(messageSendTimestamp[_xDomainCalldataHash] > 0, "Provided message has not been enqueued");
        // cannot replay dropped message
        require(!isL1MessageDropped[_xDomainCalldataHash], "Message already dropped");

        // compute and deduct the messaging fee to fee vault.
        uint256 _fee = IL1MessageQueue(_messageQueue).estimateCrossDomainMessageFee(_from, _newGasLimit);
``` 

Therefore, combined with the above description, it can be seen that replaying a message sent via L1Staking does not require any fees.

Therefore, attackers can replay the messages sent by L1Staking without paying fees. Although there is a limit on the number of times a single message can be replayed, as the state of the staker changes, more and more messages can be replayed. These useless messages consume the resources of the sequencer, but at the same time, no costs are charged to the attacker.

### Impact

Attackers can replay the messages sent by L1Staking without paying fees. Although there is a limit on the number of times a single message can be replayed, as the state of the staker changes, more and more messages can be replayed. These useless messages consume the resources of the sequencer, but at the same time, no costs are charged to the attacker.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

In `replayMessage`, if `_from` is on the whitelist, only specified people such as the stakers are allowed to replay.
