# Morph chain can be halted if there are no delegators

### Summary

Morph chain can be halted if there are no delegators

### Root Cause

The Morph chain can be halted if there are no delegators. From the code comment it is said when the sequencer set is nil, the block production will be halted.

[L2Staking.sol#L171](https://github.com/morph-l2/morph/blob/main/contracts/contracts/l2/staking/L2Staking.sol#L171)
>    /// @notice remove stakers, sync from L1. If new sequencer set is nil, layer2 will stop producing blocks

It is possible for there to be no sequencers, if there are no stakers, in order to be eligible to be a sequencer, the staker rank must be less than the `candidateNumber`

[L2Staking.sol#L554-L570](https://github.com/morph-l2/morph/blob/main/contracts/contracts/l2/staking/L2Staking.sol#L554-L570)
```solidity
    /// @notice select the size of staker with the largest staking amount, the max size is ${sequencerSetMaxSize}
    function _updateSequencerSet() internal {
        uint256 sequencerSize = sequencerSetMaxSize;
        if (rewardStarted) {
            if (candidateNumber < sequencerSetMaxSize) {
                sequencerSize = candidateNumber;
            }
        } else if (stakerAddresses.length < sequencerSetMaxSize) {
            sequencerSize = stakerAddresses.length;
        }
        address[] memory sequencerSet = new address[](sequencerSize);
        for (uint256 i = 0; i < sequencerSize; i++) {
            sequencerSet[i] = stakerAddresses[i];
        }
        ISequencer(SEQUENCER_CONTRACT).updateSequencerSet(sequencerSet);
        latestSequencerSetSize = sequencerSet.length;
    }
```
Therefore, if the `candidateNumber` is 0, the number of sequencers will also be 0. It can occur when there are no delegators (everyone has undelegated.)

[L2Staking.sol#L342-L400](https://github.com/morph-l2/morph/blob/main/contracts/contracts/l2/staking/L2Staking.sol#L342-L400)
```solidity
    /// @notice delegator unstake morph
    /// @param delegatee delegatee address
    function undelegateStake(address delegatee) external nonReentrant {
        ...
        // update candidateNumber
        if (!removed && stakerDelegations[delegatee] == 0) {
            candidateNumber -= 1;
        }
        ...
    }
```

Then the block production will halt and the chain will be halted, leading to loss of funds for time-sensitive operations occurring on the chain (ie. liquidations)

### Internal pre-conditions

1. Zero delegators

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

The block production will halt and the chain will be halted, leading to loss of funds for time-sensitive operations occurring on the chain (ie. liquidations)

### PoC

n/a

### Mitigation

Enforce a `minimumValue` for the `sequencerSize`.
