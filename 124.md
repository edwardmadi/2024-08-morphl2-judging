# Potential Double Spending of Staked Funds in Sequencer Slashing Mechanism


https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-morphl2/blob/98e0ec4c5bbd0b28f3d3a9e9159d1184bc45b38d/morph/contracts/contracts/l1/rollup/Rollup.sol#L701


```solidity
function _challengerWin(uint256 batchIndex, uint256 sequencersBitmap, string memory _type) internal {
    revertReqIndex = batchIndex;
    address challenger = challenges[batchIndex].challenger;
    uint256 reward = IL1Staking(l1StakingContract).slash(sequencersBitmap);
    batchChallengeReward[challenges[batchIndex].challenger] += (challenges[batchIndex].challengeDeposit + reward);
    emit ChallengeRes(batchIndex, challenger, _type);
}
```


The vulnerability lies in the following scenario:

1. A sequencer initiates a withdrawal of their staked funds.
2. Before the withdrawal is finalized (during the withdrawal lock period), the sequencer is slashed due to a successful challenge.
3. The _challengerWin function is called, which slashes the sequencer and rewards the challenger.
4. However, the function doesn't check if the slashed sequencer has a pending withdrawal.

The problematic part is in the L1Staking contract's slash function, which is called by _challengerWin:

```solidity
function slash(uint256 sequencersBitmap) external onlyRollupContract nonReentrant returns (uint256) {
    address[] memory sequencers = getStakersFromBitmap(sequencersBitmap);

    uint256 valueSum;
    for (uint256 i = 0; i < sequencers.length; i++) {
        if (withdrawals[sequencers[i]] > 0) {
            delete withdrawals[sequencers[i]];
            valueSum += stakingValue;
        } else if (!isStakerInDeleteList(sequencers[i])) {
            // If it is the first time to be slashed
            valueSum += stakingValue;
            _removeStaker(sequencers[i]);
            // remove from whitelist
            delete whitelist[sequencers[i]];
            removedList[sequencers[i]] = true;
        }
    }

    uint256 reward = (valueSum * rewardPercentage) / 100;
    slashRemaining += valueSum - reward;
    _transfer(rollupContract, reward);

    emit Slashed(sequencers);
    emit StakersRemoved(sequencers);

    // send message to remove stakers on l2
    _msgRemoveStakers(sequencers);

    return reward;
}
```

The vulnerability is that if a sequencer has initiated a withdrawal (withdrawals[sequencers[i]] > 0), their stake is still slashed, but they are not removed from the staker list or marked as removed. This can lead to the following issues:

1. The sequencer's stake is slashed, but they might still be able to claim their withdrawal later if the withdrawal period has passed.
2. The sequencer remains in the active staker list, potentially continuing to participate in consensus or receive rewards, despite being slashed.



#### To fix this vulnerability, 

the slash function should treat sequencers with pending withdrawals the same way as active stakers:

```solidity
function slash(uint256 sequencersBitmap) external onlyRollupContract nonReentrant returns (uint256) {
    address[] memory sequencers = getStakersFromBitmap(sequencersBitmap);

    uint256 valueSum;
    for (uint256 i = 0; i < sequencers.length; i++) {
        if (withdrawals[sequencers[i]] > 0 || !isStakerInDeleteList(sequencers[i])) {
            valueSum += stakingValue;
            _removeStaker(sequencers[i]);
            delete withdrawals[sequencers[i]];
            delete whitelist[sequencers[i]];
            removedList[sequencers[i]] = true;
        }
    }

    // Rest of the function remains the same
    ...
}
```

This change ensures that sequencers with pending withdrawals are properly removed from the system when slashed, preventing potential abuse of the withdrawal mechanism and maintaining the integrity of the sequencer set.




#### Impact:

The impact of this vulnerability is significant:

1. Potential double spending of staked funds
2. Compromise of the integrity of the sequencer set
3. Unfair distribution of slashing penalties



#### Proof of Concept (PoC) Flow:

1. Initial Setup:
   - Assume a sequencer (Alice) has staked 1000 ETH
   - The withdrawal lock period is set to 100 blocks

2. Alice initiates withdrawal:
   - Alice calls `withdraw()` in L1Staking
   - `withdrawals[Alice]` is set to `block.number + withdrawalLockBlocks`
   - Alice is removed from the active sequencer set

3. Challenge occurs:
   - Before the withdrawal lock period ends, a challenger (Bob) successfully challenges a batch that Alice was responsible for
   - The `_challengerWin` function in Rollup contract is called

4. Slashing process:
   - `slash()` in L1Staking is called with Alice's address in the `sequencersBitmap`
   - Since `withdrawals[Alice] > 0`, the following occurs:
     - `delete withdrawals[Alice]` (Alice's withdrawal request is deleted)
     - `valueSum += stakingValue` (Alice's stake is counted for slashing)
   - However, Alice is not removed from the staker list or marked as removed

5. Withdrawal claim:
   - After the original withdrawal lock period ends, Alice calls `claimUndelegation()`
   - Since Alice wasn't properly removed from the system, this transaction succeeds
   - Alice receives her full stake back, despite being slashed

6. Result:
   - The protocol has slashed Alice's stake and rewarded the challenger
   - Alice has also withdrawn her full stake
   - The protocol has effectively paid out more than it should have

This vulnerability can be triggered because:

1. The `slash()` function doesn't fully remove stakers with pending withdrawals
2. The `claimUndelegation()` function doesn't check if a staker has been slashed
3. There's no global accounting of total staked funds vs. slashed funds

To fix this, the protocol should:

1. Fully remove stakers (including those with pending withdrawals) when slashed
2. Implement a global accounting system to track total staked funds and slashed amounts
3. Add additional checks in `claimUndelegation()` to ensure the staker hasn't been slashed
