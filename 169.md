# Admin cannot `startReward` if many stakers are added as the call runs out of gas

### Summary

`L2Staking.sol::startReward` should be called by the admin once rewards should be started, typically after multiple stakers registered and are ready to vote. The problem is that this call will fail with OOG if there are more than `~150 stakers` registered which is highly likely since the max amount of stakers is `255`.

### Root Cause

[`L2Staking.sol::startReward`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-morphl2/blob/98e0ec4c5bbd0b28f3d3a9e9159d1184bc45b38d/morph/contracts/contracts/l2/staking/L2Staking.sol#L252-L275) sorts the available stakers by delegation on-chain (by insertion-sort) which does a lot of storage writes. This runs out of gas quickly the more stakers are registered.


### Internal pre-conditions

* More than `~150 stakers` are registered when `startReward` is called


### External pre-conditions

None

### Attack Path

This is instantly an issue once `~150 stakers` are registered before `startReward` has been called. 


### Impact

This breaks core functionality, making it impossible for the admin to start the payout of rewards.


### PoC

To show that `startReward` already runs out of gas when there are ~150 stakers, please add the following test to `L2Staking.sol` and execute it with `forge test --match-test test_addStakers_custom -vvvv`.

```solidity
function test_addStakers_custom() public {
    hevm.mockCall(
        address(l2Staking.MESSENGER()),
        abi.encodeCall(ICrossDomainMessenger.xDomainMessageSender, ()),
        abi.encode(address(l2Staking.OTHER_STAKING()))
    );
    assertEq(SEQUENCER_SIZE, l2Staking.getStakerAddressesLength());
    hevm.startPrank(address(l2CrossDomainMessenger));
    for (uint256 i = SEQUENCER_SIZE; i < 150; i++) {
        address staker = address(uint160(beginSeq + i));
        Types.StakerInfo memory stakerInfo = ffi.generateStakerInfo(staker);

        // Expect the SequencerSetMaxSizeUpdated event is emitted successfully.
        hevm.expectEmit(true, true, true, true);
        emit IL2Staking.StakerAdded(stakerInfo.addr, stakerInfo.tmKey, stakerInfo.blsKey);
        l2Staking.addStaker(stakerInfo);
    }
    console.log("stakerAddressesLength: ", l2Staking.getStakerAddressesLength());
    hevm.stopPrank();

    hevm.startPrank(alice);
    morphToken.approve(address(l2Staking), type(uint256).max);
    l2Staking.delegateStake(address(uint160(beginSeq + 149)), 100);
    hevm.stopPrank();

    hevm.prank(multisig);
    l2Staking.startReward();
}
```

Looking at the output of forge, we see that the call to `startReward` consumes `~12_000_000` gas, which is more than the block gas limit of `10_000_000`.


### Mitigation

There are two possible mitigations:
1) Require the admin to sort the existing stakers off-chain and just check whether the array passed to `startReward` is sorted. This would take a lot less gas and should be possible with the block gas limit of `10mil`
   * Caveat: it is not guaranteed, that at the time it gets called, the order is still the same
2) Always sort the stakers when `delegateStake` is called. Currently it is only sorted when `rewardStarted` is true, however if we remove that condition and keep the array sorted even before rewards started, it would not need to be done when `startReward` is called.
   * Caveat: this increases the gas cost for users calling `delegateStake` however since gas cost on L2 is very small, this should not be a problem
