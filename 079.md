# L2 USDC will not be able to be upgraded to native USDC

### Summary

An incorrect function signature in `L1USDCGateway.sol` will prevent the upgrade of L2 USDC to native USDC.

### Root Cause

`L1USDCGateway.sol` and `L2USDCGateway.sol` have been designed to follow the [Bridged USDC Standard](https://www.circle.com/blog/bridged-usdc-standard), which will allow for a future upgrade to native USDC.

The requirements include: (a) the ability to burn the USDC locked in L1, (b) the ability to pause the contracts for the upgrade, and (c) the ability to transfer ownership of the USDC contract on L2 to Circle.

This is mostly done correctly, however, the wrong function signature has been added to the L1 contract, which will block the upgrade from happening.

As we can see in [Circle's documenation](https://github.com/circlefin/stablecoin-evm/blob/master/doc/bridged_USDC_standard.md#2-ability-to-burn-locked-usdc), the L1 contract needs the following function:
```solidity
function burnLockedUSDC() external;
```

However, if we look in [L1USDCGateway.sol](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-morphl2/blob/main/morph/contracts/contracts/l1/gateways/usdc/L1USDCGateway.sol#L88-L96), we can see that the function signature is:
```solidity
function burnAllLockedUSDC() external;
```

### Internal pre-conditions

None

### External pre-conditions

None

### Attack Path

N/A

### Impact

The L2 USDC contract, which is intended to be able to be upgraded in the future to native USDC, will not be permitted to perform this upgrade.

### PoC

N/A

### Mitigation

Change the function name to `burnLockedUSDC()`.
