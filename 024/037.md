# Lack of Storage Gaps

## Summary
The `L2ERC1155Gateway` and `L2ERC721Gateway` contracts lack storage gaps, which could lead to storage collisions in future upgrades. In contrast, this feature is present in the [L2ERC20Gateway](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-morphl2/blob/main/morph/contracts/contracts/l2/gateways/L2ERC20Gateway.sol#L15) contract.

## Vulnerability Detail

The contract [L2ERC1155Gateway](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-morphl2/blob/main/morph/contracts/contracts/l2/gateways/L2ERC1155Gateway.sol) and [L2ERC721Gateway](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-morphl2/blob/main/morph/contracts/contracts/l2/gateways/L2ERC721Gateway.sol) is being inherited by multiple upgradeable contracts.

Without adding a storage gap, new storage variables cannot be added to L2ERC1155Gateway and L2ERC721Gateway without causing a storage collision in all the contracts that inherit from it. This would cause contracts to malfunction and compromise their functionalities.

## Impact
The lack of storage gaps in these contracts could lead to the following issues:

1. Difficulty in adding new storage variables in future upgrades without causing storage collisions.
2. Potential malfunction of contracts that inherit from these base contracts if storage layout changes are made.

## Code Snippet
```solidity
contract L2ERC1155Gateway is ERC1155HolderUpgradeable, GatewayBase, IL2ERC1155Gateway {
    // ... existing code ...
    // @audit Missing: uint256[50] private __gap;
}

contract L2ERC721Gateway is ERC721HolderUpgradeable, GatewayBase, IL2ERC721Gateway {
    // ... existing code ...
    
    // @audit Missing: uint256[50] private __gap;
}
```
## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
To address this issue, consider adding a gap variable to future-proof base contract storage changes and be safe against storage collisions.
```solidity
uint256[50] private __gap;
```
