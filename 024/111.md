# Lack of Upgradeability Storage Gap in L1Staking and L2Staking Contract

## Summary
The [L1Staking](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-morphl2/blob/main/morph/contracts/contracts/l1/staking/L1Staking.sol) and [L2Staking](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-morphl2/blob/main/morph/contracts/contracts/l2/staking/L2Staking.sol) contracts lacks storage gaps, which is crucial for safe upgradeability. This omission could lead to storage collisions in future upgrades.

## Vulnerability Detail
Upgradeable contracts require storage gaps to prevent storage collisions when new variables are added in future versions. The [L1Staking](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-morphl2/blob/main/morph/contracts/contracts/l1/staking/L1Staking.sol) and [L2Staking](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-morphl2/blob/main/morph/contracts/contracts/l2/staking/L2Staking.sol#L16) contracts, both which inherits from multiple base contracts, does not implement storage gaps. This makes the contract susceptible to storage layout collisions during upgrades.
## Impact

- Future upgrades could lead to storage collisions, causing unexpected behavior.
- The ability to safely upgrade the contracts is limited, reducing long-term maintainability.

## Code Snippet
```solidity
contract L1Staking is IL1Staking, Staking, OwnableUpgradeable, ReentrancyGuardUpgradeable {
    // ... SNIP ...
    // No storage gap present
}
```
similarly

```solidity
contract L2Staking is IL2Staking, Staking, OwnableUpgradeable, ReentrancyGuardUpgradeable {
     // ... SNIP ...
    // No storage gap present
}

```
## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Consider adding gaps variable to future-proof base contract storage changes and be safe against storage collisions.
```solidity 
contract L1Staking is IL1Staking, Staking, OwnableUpgradeable, ReentrancyGuardUpgradeable {
    // ... SNIP ...

    uint256[50] private __gap;
}

contract L2Staking is IL2Staking, Staking, OwnableUpgradeable, ReentrancyGuardUpgradeable {

   // ... SNIP ...
   
   uint256[50] private __gap;
}
```
