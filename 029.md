# Inconsistent Staker Removal Leading to Data Integrity Issues

## Summary
The `removeStakers` function in the `L2Staking` contract can lead to data integrity issues due to insufficient synchronization and validation checks when removing stakers. This can cause inconsistencies in the staking and delegation data, potentially affecting reward distribution and system operations.

## Vulnerability Detail
The root cause of this lies in the lack of comprehensive checks and updates when a staker is removed. Specifically, the function does not adequately handle the associated delegations and rankings, leading to potential inconsistencies in the contract's state.
```solidity
173:     function removeStakers(address[] calldata remove) external onlyOtherStaking {
174:         bool updateSequencerSet = false;
175:@=>      for (uint256 i = 0; i < remove.length; i++) {
176:             if (stakerRankings[remove[i]] <= latestSequencerSetSize) {
177:                 updateSequencerSet = true;
178:             }

182:                 for (uint256 j = stakerRankings[remove[i]] - 1; j < stakerAddresses.length - 1; j++) {
183:                     stakerAddresses[j] = stakerAddresses[j + 1];
184:                     stakerRankings[stakerAddresses[j]] -= 1;
185:                 }
186:                 stakerAddresses.pop();
187:                 delete stakerRankings[remove[i]];

190:                 if (stakerDelegations[remove[i]] > 0) {
191:                     candidateNumber -= 1;
192:                 }
193:             }
---
195:             delete stakers[remove[i]];
196:         }
197:         emit StakerRemoved(remove);
---
199:         if (updateSequencerSet) {
200:             _updateSequencerSet();
201:         }
202:     }
```

## Impact
- Removing a staker without updating all related data can lead to inconsistencies, such as orphaned delegations or incorrect rankings.
- Delegators not receive correct rewards if their delegations are not properly managed after a staker is removed.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
- Ensure all delegations related to the removed staker are properly updated or removed.
- Implement checks to ensure data consistency between L1 and L2 before removing a staker.
- Ensure all relevant state variables, such as `stakerRankings`, `stakerDelegations`, and `candidateNumber`, are consistently updated.
