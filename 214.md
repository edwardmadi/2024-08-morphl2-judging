# `proveAndRelayMessage()` doesn't check if user provided enough gas fee to prove a L2 => L1 message with message proof and relay a L2 => L1 message.

## Vulnerability Detail

The function `proveAndRelayMessage()` is used to prove a L2 => L1 message with message proof and relay a L2 => L1 message. If we look at the function, it passes the
`msg.value` as value to message call. Function `proveAndRelayMessage()` doesn't verify the amount of gas fee required before making the cross chain message transfer.
```solidity

    function proveAndRelayMessage(
        address _from,
        address _to,
        uint256 _value,
        uint256 _nonce,
        bytes memory _message,
        bytes32[32] calldata _withdrawalProof,
        bytes32 _withdrawalRoot
    ) external override whenNotPaused notInExecution {
        ....
        // relay message
        xDomainMessageSender = _from;
        (bool success, ) = _to.call{value: _value}(_message); // @audit doesn't check the gas fee before continuing the transaction
        ....
    }
```
The issue here is that the function `estimateCrossDomainMessageFee()` should be called before calling the transfer to estimate the gas fee for the cross domain transfer.

## Impact
Failure of message due to not providing gas by users. It may lose the gas of relayer or dos the system of L2->L1 message relay.

Manual Review
## Recommendation
We recommend to call the function `estimateCrossDomainMessageFee()` similar to `replayMessage()` function in the same contract.
