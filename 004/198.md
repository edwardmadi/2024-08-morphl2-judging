# Add default constructor that calls `_disableInitializers()` to L2 staking upgradable contracts

## Summary

`L2Staking, Sequencer, MorphToken` uses upgradable contracts.
Calling the `initialize()` function directly on the implementation contract behind a proxy is dangerous. 
In such case, if the implementation calls self-destruct or performs delegate calls itâ€™s possible to delete the implementation leaving the contract bricked. 

## Vulnerability Detail

Upgradable contracts are an essential protocol feature, allowing for flexible updates and maintenance. 
Contracts should include a default constructor calling `_disableInitializers()` function: 
(https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts-upgradeable/blob/master/contracts/proxy/utils/Initializable.sol#L192) of `Initializable.sol`.

## Impact

When implementing upgradable contracts, ensuring that the `initialize()` function is not accidentally called directly on the implementation contract behind the proxy is crucial. 

If this occurs and the implementation contract contains self-destruct or delegate calls, it can result in the unintended deletion of the implementation contract.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Please update some contracts as follows.

```diff
contract L2Staking is IL2Staking, Staking, OwnableUpgradeable, ReentrancyGuardUpgradeable {
	...
	
	constructor() {
++		_disableInitializers();
		...		
	}
	
	...
}

contract Sequencer is ISequencer, OwnableUpgradeable {
	...
	
	constructor() {
++		_disableInitializers();
		...		
	}
	
	...
}

contract MorphToken is IMorphToken, OwnableUpgradeable {
	...
	
	constructor() {
++		_disableInitializers();
		...		
	}
	
	...
}
```
