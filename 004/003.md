# Missing _disableInitializers() in L2Staking Contract

## Summary

The contract L2Staking does not invoke the _disableInitializers() function in its constructor. While this may appear to be a design choice, it leaves the implementation contract vulnerable to unauthorized initialization, which poses a significant security risk.

In proxy-based upgradeable contracts, the initialize function replaces constructors, and calling _disableInitializers() in the constructor of the implementation contract ensures it cannot be reinitialized once deployed. Without it, attackers can directly interact with the implementation contract and reinitialize it, even after the proxy contract has been initialized.

## Vulnerability Detail
https://github.com/morph-l2/morph/blob/main/contracts/contracts/l2/staking/L2Staking.sol#L103


The _disableInitializers function is not called, making the implementation contract susceptible to initialization by an attacker.

An attacker can initialize the implementation contract directly, becoming its owner. This ownership allows them to execute functions protected by onlyOwner, including those that could delegatecall a self-destruct opcode, rendering the implementation unusable and preventing proxy upgrades.

## Impact

An attacker could call initialize() on the implementation contract, passing new parameters to reset critical state variables.

The attacker could change the contractâ€™s owner by passing a new owner address to the initialize function, gaining control over the contract.

 Parameters such as sequencerSetMaxSize, rewardStartTime, and staker data could be altered, leading to inconsistencies in staking operations, and potentially breaking the functionality of the staking system.

## Code Snippet
```sol
// Constructor of the L2Staking contract

constructor(address payable _otherStaking) Staking(payable(Predeploys.L2_CROSS_DOMAIN_MESSENGER), _otherStaking) {
    MORPH_TOKEN_CONTRACT = Predeploys.MORPH_TOKEN;
    SEQUENCER_CONTRACT = Predeploys.SEQUENCER;
    DISTRIBUTE_CONTRACT = Predeploys.DISTRIBUTE;

    // Missing _disableInitializers() here
}

```


## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Add _disableInitializers() in the constructor to ensure the implementation contract is locked after deployment and cannot be re-initialized.

```sol
/// @custom:oz-upgrades-unsafe-allow constructor
constructor(address payable _otherStaking) Staking(payable(Predeploys.L2_CROSS_DOMAIN_MESSENGER), _otherStaking) {
    MORPH_TOKEN_CONTRACT = Predeploys.MORPH_TOKEN;
    SEQUENCER_CONTRACT = Predeploys.SEQUENCER;
    DISTRIBUTE_CONTRACT = Predeploys.DISTRIBUTE;

    _disableInitializers();  // Prevent further initialization after deployment
}

```

By invoking _disableInitializers(), the implementation contract will be locked from further initialization, ensuring that attackers cannot reinitialize the contract and manipulate its state.
