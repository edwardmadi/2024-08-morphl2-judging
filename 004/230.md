# Missing calls to `_disableInitializers` in multiple upgradeable contracts allows attacker to frontrun initialization

### Summary

The contracts `L2Staking`, `Sequencer` and `MorphToken` are missing a call to `_disableInitializers` in their constructors, making it possible for an attacker to frontrun initialization and have admin privileges until a new implementation is deployed.


### Root Cause

Missing call to `_disableInitializers` in [`L2Staking.sol`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-morphl2/blob/98e0ec4c5bbd0b28f3d3a9e9159d1184bc45b38d/morph/contracts/contracts/l2/staking/L2Staking.sol#L103-L107), [`Sequencer.sol`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-morphl2/blob/98e0ec4c5bbd0b28f3d3a9e9159d1184bc45b38d/morph/contracts/contracts/l2/staking/Sequencer.sol#L51-L53) and [`MorphToken.sol`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-morphl2/blob/98e0ec4c5bbd0b28f3d3a9e9159d1184bc45b38d/morph/contracts/contracts/l2/system/MorphToken.sol#L71-L75).


### Internal pre-conditions

None

### External pre-conditions

None

### Attack Path

1) Attacker monitors the mempool for creation of contracts by addresses controlled by Morph
2) Attacker frontruns the call to `initialize` before the deployed contract gets set as the implementation of the proxy
3) The attacker is now the admin of the contract
4) If now morph deploys a new implementation to reset the admin, this call can again be frontrun


### Impact

Malicious user gets admin privileges.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Consider calling `_disableInitializers` in all contracts inheriting `OwnableUpgradeable`.
