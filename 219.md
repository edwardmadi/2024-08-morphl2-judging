# Incorrect proposals can be passed in L2

## Vulnerability Detail
Scenario 1:

- Sequencer creates 2-3 different proposals with the last created proposal being the correct one.
- Votes on all proposals but none get executed due not passing the check.
- `updateSequencerSet()` is called in Sequencer.sol
- Malicious user calls `executeProposal()` for a proposal (definitely not the last correct one).
- Proposal executed. Incorrect values updated.
- `updateSequencerSet()` is called in Sequencer.sol again & the values of the set changes.
- The correct proposal does not pass & its validity expires.
- Sequencer needs to create a new proposal & wait for the `updateSequencerSet()` to be called again hoping the checks pass this time.

Scenario 2:
- `latestSequencerSet` only contains 1 value.
```solidity
   function _checkPassed(uint256 proposalID) internal view returns (bool) {
        // checking invalidate votes
        address[] memory latestSequencerSet = ISequencer(SEQUENCER_CONTRACT).getSequencerSet2();
        uint256 validVotes = 0;
        for (uint256 i = 0; i < latestSequencerSet.length; i++) {
            if (votes[proposalID].contains(latestSequencerSet[i])) {
                validVotes = validVotes + 1;
            }
        }
        return validVotes > (latestSequencerSet.length * 2) / 3;
    }
```
- Thus if the Sequencer proposes an incorrect proposal & votes, it will pass instantly.
- By the time the Sequencer creates a correct proposal & `latestSequencerSet` values have changed again, the correct proposal would not pass instantly.

## Impact
Incorrect proposal is passed.
