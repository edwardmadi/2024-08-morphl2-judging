# Attacker can fill merkle tree in `L2ToL1MessagePasser`, blocking any future withdrawals

### Summary

An attacker can fill the merkle tree used for withdrawals from `L2 -> L1`, preventing any withdrawals from `L2` to `L1`.


### Root Cause

The protocol uses one single merkle tree with a maximum of `2**32-1` entries for all ever happening withdrawals. Once that tree is full, any calls made to `L2CrossDomainMessenger.sol::_sendMessage` will fail, since [`Tree.sol::_appendMessageHash`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-morphl2/blob/98e0ec4c5bbd0b28f3d3a9e9159d1184bc45b38d/morph/contracts/contracts/libraries/common/Tree.sol#L34-L36), called in `L2ToL1MessagePasser.sol::appendMessage` will revert.

```solidity
function _appendMessageHash(bytes32 leafHash) internal {
    bytes32 node = leafHash;

    // Avoid overflowing the Merkle tree (and prevent edge case in computing `_branch`)
    if (leafNodesCount >= _MAX_DEPOSIT_COUNT) {
        revert MerkleTreeFull();
    }
    // [...]
}
```

### Internal pre-conditions

None

### External pre-conditions

None

### Attack Path

* attacker deploys a contract with a function which initiates `200` withdrawals from `L2` to `L1` per transaction by calling `l2CrossDomainMessenger.sendMessage(payable(0), 0, "", 0)` `200` times 
* they then automate calling that contract as many times as it takes to fill the `2**32-1` entries of the withdrawal merkel tree in `Tree.sol` (`~ 21_000_000 times`)
* this fills the merkle tree and once it is full, any withdrawals are blocked permanently

Cost for a DoS with the lowest gas cost: `~51152 USD` at `2400 USD/ETH`

Note that this exploit takes some time to execute. However with the low gas costs and block times on L2, it is absolutely feasible to do so causing massive damage to the protocol. Additionally, if the ether price goes down, this will cost even less to execute.


### Impact

Permanent DoS of the rollup as no `L2 -> L1` withdrawals/messages will be possible anymore.


### PoC

The following exploit puts `200 calls` into one transaction, using close to the block gas limit of `10_000_000 gas`. To run it please add it to `L2Staking.t.sol` and execute it with `forge test --match-test test_lowGasSendMessage`.

```solidity
function test_lowGasSendMessage() public {
    for (uint256 i = 0; i < 200; ++i) {
        l2CrossDomainMessenger.sendMessage(payable(0), 0, "", 0);
    }
}
```
The forge output will show it costing about `9_924_957 gas` with which the calculations in `Attack Path` were made.


### Mitigation

Consider adding different handling for when a merkle tree is full, not bricking the rollup because of a filled merkle tree.
