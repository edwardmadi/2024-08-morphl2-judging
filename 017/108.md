# L1Staking.sol - BLS Key Registration Vulnerability

## Summary

The `L1Staking.sol` contract contains a vulnerability in the `register()` function related to the registration and management of BLS public keys. Once a BLS key (`blsKey`) is registered, there is no mechanism to reset or unregister the key, which can prevent key reuse and lead to potential lockout of stakers from the system.

## Vulnerability Detail

In the `register()` function, the contract checks whether the BLS key provided by the staker has been used before, and if not, marks it as used by setting `blsKeys[blsKey] = true`. However, there is no mechanism to revert this state, meaning that once a key is registered, it can never be reused, even if the staker unregisters or needs to update their keys.

Without a way to reset the BLS key, the contract effectively locks the BLS key permanently, creating a potential exhaustion of available keys and denying stakers the ability to re-register if necessary.

## Impact

* Denial of Service for Stakers: If a staker needs to deregister or update their BLS key, they will be unable to do so, leading to a permanent lockout from staking functionalities.
* Key Exhaustion: Over time, the number of available BLS keys may become depleted as keys are permanently marked as used without a way to reset them, limiting future staker registrations.

## Code Snippet

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-morphl2/blob/98e0ec4c5bbd0b28f3d3a9e9159d1184bc45b38d/morph/contracts/contracts/l1/staking/L1Staking.sol#L161

The relevant code section from the `register()` function in the `L1Staking.sol#L161`:

```solidity
function register(bytes32 tmKey, bytes memory blsKey) external payable inWhitelist(_msgSender()) {
    require(stakers[_msgSender()].addr == address(0), "already registered");
    require(tmKey != 0 && !tmKeys[tmKey], "invalid tendermint pubkey");
    require(blsKey.length == 256 && !blsKeys[blsKey], "invalid bls pubkey");
    require(msg.value == stakingValue, "invalid staking value");

    stakers[_msgSender()] = Types.StakerInfo(_msgSender(), tmKey, blsKey);
    _addStaker(_msgSender());
@>> blsKeys[blsKey] = true;
@>> tmKeys[tmKey] = true;
    emit Registered(_msgSender(), tmKey, blsKey);

    // send message to add staker on l2
    _msgAddStaker(stakers[_msgSender()]);
}
```
Currently, there is no function in the contract to reset `blsKeys[blsKey]`, `tmKeys[tmKey]` to false when a staker unregisters or changes their key.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Introduce a function that allows stakers to unregister or modify their keys, and reset the associated BLS and Tendermint keys in the process. A potential solution could be:

```solidity
function unregister() external inWhitelist(_msgSender()) {
    require(stakers[_msgSender()].addr != address(0), "not registered");

    // Reset BLS and Tendermint keys
    blsKeys[stakers[_msgSender()].blsKey] = false;
    tmKeys[stakers[_msgSender()].tmKey] = false;

    // Remove staker info
    delete stakers[_msgSender()];
    emit Unregistered(_msgSender());
}
```
This function ensures that the keys are reset to allow future reuse and that stakers can deregister properly without facing permanent lockout.
