# The first staker is skipped whenever reordering stakers

### Description
When a user wants to delegate a stake, they can call the [`delegateStake`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-morphl2/blob/main/morph/contracts/contracts/l2/staking/L2Staking.sol#L284-L340) function:

```javascript
function delegateStake(address delegatee, uint256 amount) external isStaker(delegatee) nonReentrant {
//..Omitted code
    uint256 beforeRanking = stakerRankings[delegatee];
    if (rewardStarted && beforeRanking > 1) {
        // Update stakers and rankings
        for (uint256 i = beforeRanking - 1; i > 0; i--) {
            if (stakerDelegations[stakerAddresses[i]] > stakerDelegations[stakerAddresses[i - 1]]) {
                address tmp = stakerAddresses[i - 1];
                stakerAddresses[i - 1] = stakerAddresses[i];
                stakerAddresses[i] = tmp;

                stakerRankings[stakerAddresses[i - 1]] = i;
                stakerRankings[stakerAddresses[i]] = i + 1;
            }
        }
    }
    uint256 effectiveEpoch = rewardStarted ? currentEpoch() + 1 : 0;

//..Omitted code
```

In this function, `beforeRanking` is assigned the value of `stakerRankings[delegatee]`. After that, a check is performed to ensure the rewards have started and `beforeRanking > 1`, which means only stakers ranked below the top spot are considered for ranking updates.

the first position represents the first staker added through the `AddStaker` function, which is called whenever a new staker is registered:

```javascript
function addStaker(Types.StakerInfo calldata add) external onlyOtherStaking {
    if (stakerRankings[add.addr] == 0) {
        stakerAddresses.push(add.addr);
=>      stakerRankings[add.addr] = stakerAddresses.length;
    }
    stakers[add.addr] = add;
    emit StakerAdded(add.addr, add.tmKey, add.blsKey);

    if (!rewardStarted && stakerAddresses.length <= sequencerSetMaxSize) {
        _updateSequencerSet();
    }
}
```

In this function, `stakerRankings` is set to the length of `stakerAddresses`. As a result:

-  Bob registers as a staker.
-  `addStaker` is called, adding Bob as the first entry in `stakerAddresses`.
-  Bob's ranking is automatically set to `stakerRankings[delegatee] = 1`.
-  Other stakers with higher Morph token delegations than Bob are added later.
-  Alice delegates her stake to Bob by calling `delegateStake`.

When Alice's delegation occurs, the following check is performed:

```javascript
uint256 beforeRanking = stakerRankings[delegatee];
if (rewardStarted && beforeRanking > 1) {
```

Since Bob was the first staker added, his `stakerRankings[delegatee]` is set to 1, so `beforeRanking` is 1. This means the rankings and stakers will not be updated when delegating to Bob because the assumption is that Bob has the highest delegation count, even though he was simply the first to be added.

This creates an issue where Bob remains in the first position, even if he no longer has the highest Morph delegation count. Additionally, when Alice delegates to anyone other than Bob, the rankings for stakers with `beforeRanking > 1` are updated, but Bob stays in first place regardless.

As a result Bob will be chosen as a sequencer, as per the [docs](https://docs.morphl2.io/docs/how-morph-works/decentralized-sequencers/morph-staking-system-design/#staking--sequencer-selection):
> 1. `L2`Â Sequencer Contract: L2 staking contract will update the sequencer set by calling L2 sequencer contact based on the ranking of the Morph token delegation amount, the top staker will be elected as sequencer.

### Recommendation
Unsure what the best mitigation is here, but one possible solution could be to iterate over all rankings, including the first one, whenever `delegateStake` is called.
