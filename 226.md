# Improper input validation on updateSequencerSetMaxSize()

### Summary

The updateSequencerSetMaxSize() function does not check for extreme values for the new sequencer set size.

### Root Cause

The updateSequencerSetMaxSize() function lacks input validation, allowing a malicious actor to set the sequencer set size to extreme values disrupting protocol operations 

### Internal pre-conditions

1. The owner must call updateSequencerSetMaxSize() with a arbitrary value
2. There is no upper or lower bound for the sequencer set size, enabling values like 0 to 1,000

### External pre-conditions

The attacker must either control the owner account or be able to influence the governance mechanism that controls this function 

### Attack Path

1. The attacker, controlling the owner account, calls updateSequencerSetMaxSize() with a value of 0, halting sequencer operations 
2. Alternatively, the attacker sets the value to 1,000, drastically increasing the number of sequencers and reducing efficiency 

### Impact

- If value is set to 0, the protocol halts, leading to a complete loss of transaction processing ability. Potential loss: $500,000 in transaction fees and staking rewards over a week
- If the value is set too high, transaction confirmation times increase due to inefficiency, causing user frustration and eventual exit from platform 

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Introduce input validation with reasonable bounds for the sequencer set size, e.g., between 10 and 100, to prevent extreme values
