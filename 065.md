# Possible DOS (Deny Of Service) if _refundAddress is a contract that cannot receive eth

### Summary

The `sendMessage()::L1CrossDomainMessenger.sol` function will fail if `_refundAddress` is a contract that cannot receive ether.

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-morphl2/blob/main/morph/contracts/contracts/l1/L1CrossDomainMessenger.sol#L112-L120

### Root Cause

In L1CrossDomainMessenger.sol : 
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-morphl2/blob/main/morph/contracts/contracts/l1/L1CrossDomainMessenger.sol#L359-L363

```Solidity
uint256 _refund = msg.value - _fee - _value;
            if (_refund > 0) {
                (bool _success, ) = _refundAddress.call{value: _refund}(""); // <-- can cause a DOS (Deny Of Service)
                require(_success, "Failed to refund the fee");
            }
```

These lines of code can cause a DOS : Deny Of Service.
If the `_refundAddress` is a contract that can not receive ether, meaning neither a `receive() payable` nor `fallback() payable` function is implemented, the transaction will automatically fail.


### External pre-conditions

1. `_refundAddress` is a contract
2. `_refundAddress` does not implement a `receive() payable` function nor a `fallback() payable` function.
3. There is a `_refund` amount to refund

### Attack Path

1. `_refundAddress` is a contract that can not receive ETH
2. there is a surplus of eth sent by the user, meaning there is a `_refund` amount to send to the `_refundAddress`
3. the contract tries to send this `_refund` amount of native ETH to the `_refundAddress`
4. the transaction fails

### Impact

Deny Of Service, the transaction will fail every time.

### Mitigation

One possibility would be to convert the `_refund` amount to `wrap ether` (WETH), and then send it to the `_refundAddress`. 
Wether `_refundAddress` is a contract able to receive ether or not, the transaction will always go through.

Or, check if the `_refundAddress` is a contract, if it's not => refund with native ether, if it is
=> refund with Wrap Ether (WETH).
