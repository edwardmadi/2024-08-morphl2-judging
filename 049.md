# initialize() functions are front-runnable due to missing access control

### Summary

There are no access control checks on initialize() functions used to configure the protocol during the deployment.
An attacker could front-run the deployment process and call initialize() functions to set their own parameters, e.g.
set arbitrary implementation and token addresses or modify intended ownerships.


### Impact:
Initializers could be front-run, allowing an attacker to either set their values, take ownership of the contract, and in the best case force a re-deployment.
