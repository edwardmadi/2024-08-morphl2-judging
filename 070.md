# multiple RemoveStakers messages can be pending resulting in a failing slash

### Description
Inside the [`slash`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-morphl2/blob/main/morph/contracts/contracts/l1/staking/L1Staking.sol#L217-L246) function, a message is dispatched to remove all stakers on L2:

```javascript
    function slash(uint256 sequencersBitmap) external onlyRollupContract nonReentrant returns (uint256) {
        address[] memory sequencers = getStakersFromBitmap(sequencersBitmap);
        uint256 valueSum;
        for (uint256 i = 0; i < sequencers.length; i++) {
            if (withdrawals[sequencers[i]] > 0) {
                delete withdrawals[sequencers[i]];
                valueSum += stakingValue;
            } else if (!isStakerInDeleteList(sequencers[i])) {
                // If this is the first time the sequencer is slashed
                valueSum += stakingValue;
                _removeStaker(sequencers[i]);
                // Remove from whitelist
                delete whitelist[sequencers[i]];
                removedList[sequencers[i]] = true;
            }
        }

        uint256 reward = (valueSum * rewardPercentage) / 100;
        slashRemaining += valueSum - reward;
        _transfer(rollupContract, reward);

        emit Slashed(sequencers);
        emit StakersRemoved(sequencers);

        // Dispatch message to remove stakers on L2
=>        _msgRemoveStakers(sequencers);

        return reward;
    }
```

The issue is that the `sequencers` array may contain stakers that have an already pending removal. To illustrate, consider the `removeStaker` function, for instance:

```javascript
    function removeStaker(address[] memory _stakers) external onlyOwner {
        for (uint256 i = 0; i < _stakers.length; i++) {
            require(isActiveStaker(_stakers[i]), "only active staker can be removed");
            require(withdrawals[_stakers[i]] == 0, "withdrawing");

            withdrawals[_stakers[i]] = block.number + withdrawalLockBlocks;
            _removeStaker(_stakers[i]);
            emit Withdrawn(_stakers[i], withdrawals[_stakers[i]]);

            delete whitelist[_stakers[i]];
            removedList[_stakers[i]] = true;
        }
        emit StakersRemoved(_stakers);

        // Dispatch message to remove stakers on L2
=>        _msgRemoveStakers(_stakers);
    }

```

This function also sends a message to remove stakers on L2. 

Given this, the following scenario can occur:
- The contract `Owner` invokes `removeStaker` for `Alice`.
- A message is sent to remove `Alice` as a staker.
- not much later, a `slash` function is triggered, perhaps because a challenger was successful.
- `Alice` is included in the array of `sequencers` to be slashed
- After some checks, `_msgRemoveStakers` is called to dispatch a message to remove all `sequencers`, including `Alice`.
- However, `Alice's` first removal request goes through first 
- This will cause the second removal request, initiated by slashing, to fail.
- Ultimately the complete slashing operation will fail

As per the sponsor: 
> there should be no situation where stakers are removed repeatedly

In the current scenario, two messages will be sent to remove Alice. The first message, `removeStaker`, will succeed, while shortly after, the `slash` function will be called with Alice included as a sequencer, which will ultimately fail.

### Recommendation
introduce some sort of logic to mitigate this issue. Perhaps you might want to perform a pending removal check whenever performing the `slash` function.
