# _approve method in the Morph contract uses allowance even if spender == from

## Summary

https://github.com/morph-l2/morph/blob/main/contracts/contracts/l2/system/MorphToken.sol#L390


https://github.com/morph-l2/morph/blob/main/contracts/contracts/l2/system/MorphToken.sol#L404


https://github.com/morph-l2/morph/blob/main/contracts/contracts/l2/system/MorphToken.sol#L185

The transferFrom function calls _spendAllowance, which ultimately calls _approve to reduce the allowance for the spender, even when the spender is the same as the owner.

## Vulnerability Detail

In the transferFrom function, the _spendAllowance method is invoked regardless of whether the spender (i.e., msg.sender) is the same as the owner.

This behavior is non-compliant with the ERC20 standard, where allowances should only be managed when spender !=  owner. This leads to compatibility issues and may result in unnecessary allowance management and the potential for stranded tokens.

## Impact

Compatibility Issues: 

Protocols expecting standard ERC20 behavior may fail to integrate properly with the MorphToken contract. Systems that expect allowances to be checked only when spender != from may encounter operational issues.

User Experience: 

Users will be required to manage allowances even for self-transfers, which is unnecessary and can be confusing. This deviates from the standard ERC20 behavior, where self-transfers donâ€™t require allowance management.

Potential for Stranded Tokens: 

Tokens may become stranded in systems that rely on standard ERC20 behavior, as the MorphToken contract's behavior can deviate from expectations when dealing with allowances.

Gas Inefficiency: 

Unnecessary allowance checks and updates result in higher gas costs, especially for self-transfers, where no allowance should need to be managed.


## Code Snippet

```sol

function _spendAllowance(address owner, address spender, uint256 amount) internal {

    uint256 currentAllowance = allowance(owner, spender);

    if (currentAllowance != type(uint256).max) {

        require(currentAllowance >= amount, "insufficient allowance");

        unchecked {

            _approve(owner, spender, currentAllowance - amount);

        }

    }

}



// This logic is invoked in the transferFrom function:



function transferFrom(address from, address to, uint256 amount) public override returns (bool) {

    address spender = _msgSender();

    _spendAllowance(from, spender, amount);  // Unnecessary allowance deduction for self-transfers

    _transfer(from, to, amount);

    return true;

}

function _approve(address owner, address spender, uint256 amount) internal {

    require(owner != address(0), "approve from the zero address");

    require(spender != address(0), "approve to the zero address");



    _allowances[owner][spender] = amount;

    emit Approval(owner, spender, amount);

}




```

approve updates the allowance mapping for the owner and spender, even when they are the same person, leading to redundant allowance updates during self-transfers.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

modify the _spendAllowance method, which will prevent unnecessary calls to _approve during self-transfers.



Updated _spendAllowance:
 add a check to skip allowance deduction for self-transfers.




```sol

function _spendAllowance(address owner, address spender, uint256 amount) internal {

    if (owner != spender) {  // Skip allowance deduction for self-transfers

        uint256 currentAllowance = allowance(owner, spender);

        if (currentAllowance != type(uint256).max) {

            require(currentAllowance >= amount, "insufficient allowance");

            unchecked {

                _approve(owner, spender, currentAllowance - amount);

            }

        }

    }

}

```
