# Inefficient Gas Usage in `claimAll` Function Leading to Potential Transaction Failure

## Summary
The `claimAll` function in the `Distribute` contract may lead to inefficient gas usage when a delegator has a large number of delegatees. This inefficiency can cause transactions to exceed the block gas limit, resulting in transaction failures.

## Vulnerability Detail
The `claimAll` function iterates over all delegatees associated with a delegator to calculate and claim rewards. This loop, combined with multiple operations within each iteration, can consume a significant amount of gas, especially if the number of delegatees is large.
```solidity
200:     function claimAll(address delegator, uint256 targetEpochIndex) external onlyL2StakingContract {
201:         require(mintedEpochCount != 0, "not minted yet");
202:         uint256 endEpochIndex = (targetEpochIndex == 0 || targetEpochIndex > mintedEpochCount - 1)
203:             ? mintedEpochCount - 1
204:             : targetEpochIndex;
205:         uint256 reward;
206:@=>      for (uint256 i = 0; i < unclaimed[delegator].delegatees.length(); i++) {
207:             address delegatee = unclaimed[delegator].delegatees.at(i);
208:             if (
209:                 unclaimed[delegator].delegatees.contains(delegatee) &&
210:                 unclaimed[delegator].unclaimedStart[delegatee] <= endEpochIndex
211:             ) {
212:                 reward += _claim(delegatee, delegator, endEpochIndex);
213:             }
214:         }
215:         if (reward > 0) {
216:             _transfer(delegator, reward);
217:         }
218:     }
```
Main Issues:
- The loop at the line `for (uint256 i = 0; i < unclaimed[delegator].delegatees.length(); i++)` can cause high gas usage if `unclaimed[delegator].delegatees` has many elements.
- Each iteration calls `_claim`, which also performs complex operations and state modifications, increasing gas consumption.

## Impact
- If the number of delegates is large, transactions may exceed the block gas limit, causing transaction failures.
- Users will face high gas fees to run this function, making it impractical to use in scenarios with many delegatees.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
- Modify the function to allow processing in smaller batches.
- Reduce unnecessary data access and ensure that only necessary data is processed in each iteration.
