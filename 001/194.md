# Proven batches still need to await `finalizeTimestamp`, slowing the rollup down

### Summary

When a batch gets challenged but then proven to be valid, that batch still needs to wait for `finalizeTimestamp` to expire. This slows the rollup down significantly as such batches should be finalized instantly since they were proven to be valid.


### Root Cause

[`Rollup.sol::_defenderWin`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-morphl2/blob/98e0ec4c5bbd0b28f3d3a9e9159d1184bc45b38d/morph/contracts/contracts/l1/rollup/Rollup.sol#L691-L695) does not modify the `finalizeTimestamp` of a proven batch even though it should be set to `block.timestamp` to allow instant finalization.


### Internal pre-conditions

None

### External pre-conditions

None

### Attack Path

* Staker submits valid batch
* Challenger challenges it incorrectly
* The batch gets proven to be valid by `proveState`
* The batch now still needs to wait the whole `finalizationPeriodSeconds` to be finalized (currently `1 day`)


### Impact

The rollup is slower than it should be as finalizing batches in this edge case takes longer than it should.


### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Consider setting `batchDataStore[batchIndex].finalizeTimestamp = block.timestamp` to enable instant finalization of proven batches.
