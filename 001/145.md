# Malicious challenger can brick `finalizeTimestamp` of unfinalized batches

## Summary
A malicious challenger can brick the delay for the finalization of batches. This is possible due to the uncapped extension of the finalization period for all unfinalized batches within the `challengeState` function.
## Vulnerability Detail
The `challengeState` function extends the `finalizeTimestamp` by doing an addition with the `proofWindow` variable (2 days) for each index (all unfinalized batches) except the challenged one, with not a single check or safeguard:
```solidity 
        for (uint256 i = lastFinalizedBatchIndex + 1; i <= lastCommittedBatchIndex; i++) {
            if (i != batchIndex) {
                batchDataStore[i].finalizeTimestamp += proofWindow;
            }
        }
```
The permissionless `proveState` function allows anyone including challengers to provide a ZK-proof and immediate resolution of a challenge, setting inChallenge to false:
```solidity 
        // Mark challenge as finished
        challenges[_batchIndex].finished = true;
        inChallenge = false;
```
Attack details: 
- An attack window of 15 minutes (could be longer)
     - 15 minutes = ~ 75 Ethereum blocks (12 seconds per block)
     - Challenge-prove cycle (due to `inChallenge` flag) => 2 blocks per cycle => 37 batches
     - Each cycle extends the finalization period for all other batches by `proofWindow` = 2 days (37 cycles * 2 days per cycle) means that each batch would inccur an additional extension of ~74 days! 
- Attackers capital: 37 ETH => while risking only 1 ETH! 
     - Or maybe not, because the malicious challenger could get his deposit back whenever admin pauses the contract [see Rollup::L444](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-morphl2/blob/98e0ec4c5bbd0b28f3d3a9e9159d1184bc45b38d/morph/contracts/contracts/l1/rollup/Rollup.sol#L448)   
     - `claimReward` function doesn't have a `whenNotPaused` modifier meaning that the owner has no ability to freeze attackers funds [see Rollup::L543](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-morphl2/blob/98e0ec4c5bbd0b28f3d3a9e9159d1184bc45b38d/morph/contracts/contracts/l1/rollup/Rollup.sol#L543)

**This combination allows an attacker to:**
1. Pre-generate ZK proofs for multiple batches (32 unfinalized batch)
2. Call `challengeState` function - Initiate a challenge on a batch 
3. Call `proveState` function - Immediately prove the batch in the next block
- Repeat steps 2-3 for multiple batches (32 times)

Result: Each cycle extends the finalization period for all other batches by proofWindow (2 days), `finalizeTimestamp` accumulate a significant delay due to repetitive extension.
## Impact
- Massive delay for unfinalized batches (uncapped delay)
       - Huge impact on L2
       - Short-term: loss of time and money

## Tool used
Manual Review
## Recommendation
Fix the current design by implementing some of these mitigation (mainly safguards):
-  Implement a cooldown period between challenges for the same challenger address
- Cap the maximum extension of the finalization period
- Check which unfinalized batches requires a extension within the loop
- Break this attack incentive ?
        - Implement withdrawal lock period for withrawal request to monitor any suspicious activity
        - Add a `whenNotPaused` modifier on the `claimReward` function, incase of exploit could freeze funds 
- Ultimately restrict the "prover" actor (mitigation from sponsor discussed in private thread).
