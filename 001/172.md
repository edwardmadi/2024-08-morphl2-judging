# If `withdrawalLockBlocks < proofWindow`, stakers can act maliciously without risking loss of their stake

### Summary

The table in the `README` at `https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1KDQ8LkB53yw7f0m8a0LCTIdyiANjKyqC-sKUQEQGSf8/edit?usp=sharing` specifies ranges for `proofWindow` and `withdrawalLockBlocks` which allow stakers to act maliciously without fearing consequences.


### Root Cause

This is caused by the system not restricting `withdrawalLockBlocks` enough as there currently is no limiting relation between `withdrawalLockBlocks` and `proofWindow`.

`withdrawalLockBlocks` is restricted in the following way:
* `> 2* finalize time`
  * `finalizationPeriodSeconds > 900`

On the other hand `proofWindow` has the following restriction:
* `172800 ~ 604800`

This shows that it is entirely possible for `withdrawalLockBlocks < proofWindow`.


Looking at [`L1Staking.sol::withdraw`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-morphl2/blob/98e0ec4c5bbd0b28f3d3a9e9159d1184bc45b38d/morph/contracts/contracts/l1/staking/L1Staking.sol#L201), we can see that the withdrawal lock is entirely decoupled from the locks in the rollup which can be verified by looking at [`Rollup.sol::proveState`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-morphl2/blob/98e0ec4c5bbd0b28f3d3a9e9159d1184bc45b38d/morph/contracts/contracts/l1/rollup/Rollup.sol#L484) as this is also not dependent on the withdrawal lock in the staking contract.


### Internal pre-conditions

* `withdrawalLockBlocks` is set smaller than `proofWindow`

### External pre-conditions

None

### Attack Path

* staker (`alice`) commits faulty batch
* `alice` instantly calls `withdraw`, starting a locking period of `withdrawalLockBlocks` (range: `> 1800 seconds`)
* her batch gets challenged, entering a challenge period of  `proofWindow` (range: `172800 - 604800 seconds`)
* if now `withdrawalLockBlocks < proofWindow`, she can call `claimWithdrawal`, receiving her staked `ETH` before being slashed


### Impact

* The stakers can act maliciously without facing any consequences.  


### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Now it would not be enough to just say `withdrawalLockBlocks` needs to be bigger than `proofWindow` since a batch can also be challenged near to the end of its `finalizationPeriodSeconds`. This means instead, at least the following relation needs to be enforced:
* `withdrawalLockBlocks > finalizationPeriodSeconds + proofWindow`
In order to play it safe, better increase the right side a bit.
