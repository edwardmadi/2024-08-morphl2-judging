# The finalization of batches stays slowed after defender win

## Summary
Batches finalization stays slowed while it was already proven that the challenged batch was valid.

## Vulnerability Detail

A batch gets challenged and all unfinalized batches get their `finalizeTimestamp` increased with proofWindow. Let's assume proofWindow == 2 days. 

If a defender successfully proves that a batch is valid 0.5 days after the challenge was placed then the rest of the time left (1.5 days) will have to be awaited by the other unfinalized batches.

Before challenge:

```solidity
[   batch1,     batch2,     batch3,     batch4,     batch5  ]
[   1 day,      1 day,      1 day,      1 day,      1 day   ] - finalizeTimestamp
```

After challenging batch1:

```solidity
[   batch1,     batch2,     batch3,     batch4,     batch5  ]
[   1 day,      3 days,     3 days,     3 days,     3 days  ] - finalizeTimestamp (time left)
```

Waiting 1.5 days is not necessary because it was already proven that batch1 is valid and the finalization process can proceed.

## Impact
Batches finalization is slowed unnecessarily.

## Recommendation

The `finalizeTimestamp` of the batches following the proven batch and the <b>ones that were increased due to this batch being challenged</b> can be reduced by 1.5 days to avoid slowing down the finalization process. Newly committed batches that were added after the challenge and that didn't have their `finalizeTimestamp` increased as a result of this batch should not be reduced.
