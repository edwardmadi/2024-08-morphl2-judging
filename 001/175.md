# `Rollup.sol::setPause` deleting the current challenge without adapting `finalizeTimestamp` allows finalization of faulty batches

### Summary

If the rollup gets paused while a challenge is happening, if the challenged batch is faulty, this allows it to be finalized if `timePaused > proofWindowLeft`.

Note that this can `NOT` be classified as `Admin behaving incorrectly`, as the `setPause` function is supposed to allow operations to resume as normal when unpausing. Also, this does not require the admin to behave incorrectly, in fact there is no way for an admin to prevent this if the protocol needs to be paused for the duration mentioned above. Additionally, the admin himself has no controll over when a situation may occur which requires the rollup to be paused.


### Root Cause

When pausing, [`Rollup.sol::setPause`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-morphl2/blob/98e0ec4c5bbd0b28f3d3a9e9159d1184bc45b38d/morph/contracts/contracts/l1/rollup/Rollup.sol#L444-L457) just deletes the currently active challenge without taking expiration times into consideration.

```solidity
function setPause(bool _status) external onlyOwner {
    if (_status) {
        _pause();
        if (inChallenge) {
            batchChallengeReward[challenges[batchChallenged].challenger] += challenges[batchChallenged]
                .challengeDeposit;
            delete challenges[batchChallenged];
            inChallenge = false;
        }
    }
    // [...]
}
```

### Internal pre-conditions

None

### External pre-conditions

Rollup paused at a certain time


### Attack Path

* Staker commits faulty batch -> `finalizeTimestamp = block.timestamp + finalizationPeriodSeconds`, we take `finalizationPeriodSeconds = 1 day` (current value on mainnet)
* Batch gets challenged -> challenge period is `proofWindow = 2 days`
* `1 day` passes, `finalizeTimestamp` has expired
* Admin needs to pause the rollup (for whatever reason)
* The faulty batch's challenge gets deleted
* Since the `finalizeTimestamp` has expired, the staker can instantly call `finalizeBatch`, finalizing the faulty batch
* Profit

### Impact

Finalization of faulty batches, allowing a malicious actor to drain all funds from the rollup.


### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Consider adding `proofWindow` to the `finalizeTimestamp` of the currently challenged batch to compensate for the time ellapsed since the batch was challenged.
