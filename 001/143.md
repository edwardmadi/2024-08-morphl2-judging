# Batches committed during an on going challenge can avoid being challenged

 NOTE : This finding is not the same as Known issue # 10, that is about an invalid batch getting finalized due to `challengeState()` reverting (OOG error)

## Summary
Batches committed during an ongoing challenge can avoid being challenged and pre-maturely finalize if the defender wins

## Vulnerability Detail

After a batch is committed, there is a finalization window, in which challengers can challenge the batch's validity, after the period has elapsed, the batch can be finalized.

A batch can be challenged using `challengeState()` :

```solidity
    function challengeState(uint64 batchIndex) external payable onlyChallenger nonReqRevert whenNotPaused {
        require(!inChallenge, "already in challenge");
        require(lastFinalizedBatchIndex < batchIndex, "batch already finalized");
        require(committedBatches[batchIndex] != 0, "batch not exist");
        require(challenges[batchIndex].challenger == address(0), "batch already challenged");
        // check challenge window
        require(batchInsideChallengeWindow(batchIndex), "cannot challenge batch outside the challenge window");
        // check challenge amount
        require(msg.value >= IL1Staking(l1StakingContract).challengeDeposit(), "insufficient value");

        batchChallenged = batchIndex;
        challenges[batchIndex] = BatchChallenge(batchIndex, _msgSender(), msg.value, block.timestamp, false, false);
        emit ChallengeState(batchIndex, _msgSender(), msg.value);

        for (uint256 i = lastFinalizedBatchIndex + 1; i <= lastCommittedBatchIndex; i++) {
            if (i != batchIndex) {
                batchDataStore[i].finalizeTimestamp += proofWindow;
            }
        }

        inChallenge = true;
    }
```

As you can see, the function loops through all the unfinalized batches, except the batch being challenged and adds a `proofWindow` to their finalization timestamp. This is to compensate for the amount of time these batches cannot be challenged, which is the duration of the current challenge, i.e, `proofWindow` (only one batch can be challenged at a time).

However, [`commitBatch()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-morphl2/blob/98e0ec4c5bbd0b28f3d3a9e9159d1184bc45b38d/morph/contracts/contracts/l1/rollup/Rollup.sol#L201) allows batches to get committed even when a challenge is going on and does not compensate for time spent inside the challenge :

```solidity
            batchDataStore[_batchIndex] = BatchData(
                block.timestamp,
                block.timestamp + finalizationPeriodSeconds, 
                _loadL2BlockNumber(batchDataInput.chunks[_chunksLength - 1]),
                // Before BLS is implemented, the accuracy of the sequencer set uploaded by rollup cannot be guaranteed.
                // Therefore, if the batch is successfully challenged, only the submitter will be punished.
                IL1Staking(l1StakingContract).getStakerBitmap(_msgSender()) // => batchSignature.signedSequencersBitmap
            );
```

As you can see, the new batch can be finalized after `finalizationPeriodSeconds`.

Currently the value of `finalizationPeriodSeconds` is `86400`, i.e, `1 Day` and `proofWindow` is `172800`, i.e, `2 Days`
[Source](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1KDQ8LkB53yw7f0m8a0LCTIdyiANjKyqC-sKUQEQGSf8/edit?gid=0#gid=0). This means that a batch committed just after the start of a challenge will be ready to be finalized in just 1 day, before the ongoing challenge even ends.

Now, consider the following scenario :

- A batch is finalized 
- A challenger challenges this batch, challenge will end 2 days from the start
- A staker commits a new batch
- After 1 day, this new batch is ready to be finalized, but can't be finalized yet as the parent batch (the challenged batch) needs to be finalized first
- After 1.5 days, the original batch finishes its challenge, the defender wins(by providing a valid ZK proof), and the batch is ready to be finalized
- Right after the original batch is finalized, the new batch is finalized

This leaves no time for a challenger to challenge the new batch, and this can lead to invalid batches getting committed, even if the batch committer (sequencer) doesn't act maliciously.

Since `finalizeBatch()` is permissionless and only checks whether a batch is in the finalization window, anyone can batch the two `finalizeBatch()` calls which finalize both the original batch and the invalid batch, right after the challenge ends (by back running `proveState()`), leaving no time for a challenger to call `challengeState()`

If a sequencer is malicious, they can easily exploit this to commit invalid batches

## Recommendation
You can make the following change, which correctly compensates for the lost finalization time:

```diff
            batchDataStore[_batchIndex] = BatchData(
                block.timestamp,
-                block.timestamp + finalizationPeriodSeconds, 
+                 block.timestamp + finalizationPeriodSeconds + (inChallenge ? proofWindow - (block.timestamp - challenges[batchChallenged].startTime) : 0),
                _loadL2BlockNumber(batchDataInput.chunks[_chunksLength - 1]),
                // Before BLS is implemented, the accuracy of the sequencer set uploaded by rollup cannot be guaranteed.
                // Therefore, if the batch is successfully challenged, only the submitter will be punished.
                IL1Staking(l1StakingContract).getStakerBitmap(_msgSender()) // => batchSignature.signedSequencersBitmap
            );
```
