# `Rollup.sol::setPause` not updating the `finalizeTimestamp` when the rollup gets unpaused allows for finalization of faulty batches

### Summary

When the rollup gets paused, the time between pausing and unpausing is not reflected on the `finalizeTimestamp` of committed batches. This allows faulty batches to be finalized instantly after a pause which is longer than `finalizationPeriodSeconds`. Note that `finalizationPeriodSeconds` has a default range of `>900 seconds`, making this scenario highly likely to happen at some point.

Note also that this is `NOT` an admin mistake as the admin cannot handle this case properly as there is no admin functionality to prevent this, making it impossible for an admin to prevent this issue if pause ever exceeds `finalizationPeriodSeconds`.


### Root Cause

In [`Rollup.sol::setPause`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-morphl2/blob/98e0ec4c5bbd0b28f3d3a9e9159d1184bc45b38d/morph/contracts/contracts/l1/rollup/Rollup.sol#L454-L456), when unpausing, there is nothing done except calling `_unpause`. However here, all `finalizeTimestamp`s of all committed batches should be increased by the time difference of the `pause` and the `unpause` call to prevent finalization of batches before anyone had the chance to challenge them.

### Internal pre-conditions

None

### External pre-conditions

Rollup gets paused at a certain time


### Attack Path

* Staker commits faulty batch
* Admin pauses the rollup (now here it does not matter whether the batch in question was challenged at that point)
* The pause takes more than `finalizeTimestamp` which can be as low as `900 seconds` as per the `README`
* Once unpaused, the staker can instantly call `finalizeBatch`, finalizing the faulty batch
* Profit

### Impact

Finalization of faulty batches, allowing a malicious actor to drain the rollup.


### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Consider adding a state variable `pauseTimestamp` to the contract which gets set to `block.timestamp` once the contract gets paused and when it gets unpaused, the difference of `block.timestamp - pauseTimestamp` gets added to the `finalizeTimestamp` of all committed batches. This would resume the operation of the rollup as it was before the pause.
