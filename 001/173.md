# `Rollup.sol::challengeState` increases the `finalizeTimestamp` for batches which were unsuccessfully challenged, allowing for a permanent DoS of the rollup

### Summary

Note: this issue has the exact same impact as the issue "A single malicious challenger can DoS the L1 rollup permanently because `Rollup.sol::_defenderWin` does not burn a portion of the `challengeDeposit`", but the rootcause is a different one with a different fix, which is why I split them into two distinct issues.

The fact that `Rollup.sol::challengeState` increases the `finalizeTimestamp` of every batch other than the currently challenged one can be leveraged by a challenger to DoS the rollup permanently.

### Root Cause

In [`Rollup.sol::challengeState`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-morphl2/blob/98e0ec4c5bbd0b28f3d3a9e9159d1184bc45b38d/morph/contracts/contracts/l1/rollup/Rollup.sol#L382-L384), the `finalizeTimestamp` for every batch other than the currently challenged one is increased by `proofWindow`. This is necessary for unchallenged batches as they could otherwise be finalized before a challenger even had the chance to challenge them. However this should not be done for batches that have already been challenged. If a batch gets challenged and it was proven to not be faulty, that batch's `finalizeTimestamp` is increased in `Rollup.sol::challengeState` even though there is no reason for it.

`Rollup.sol::challengeState` increases the `finalizeTimestamp` even for batches which already got challenged, increasing their time even though it is not necessary.

```solidity
function challengeState(uint64 batchIndex) external payable onlyChallenger nonReqRevert whenNotPaused {
    // [...]
    for (uint256 i = lastFinalizedBatchIndex + 1; i <= lastCommittedBatchIndex; i++) {
        if (i != batchIndex) {
            batchDataStore[i].finalizeTimestamp += proofWindow;
        }
    }
    // [...]
}
```

### Attack Path

* challenger (`alice`) pre-computes a proof for all existing (non-faulty) batches
* `alice` then starts by challenging one of these batches by calling `challengeState`
  * this will increase the `finalizeTimestamp` of all other batches by `proofWindow` (currently set to `2 days`, can be up to `7 days`)
* in the same transaction, or directly after that, `alice` calls `proofState` with the precomputed proof
* this will accredit her the whole `challengeDeposit` which she should lose due to making an incorrect challenge.
* this is then repeated for all existing batches, increasing the `finalizeTimestamp` of all batches for every challenged batch
* the `finalizationPeriodSeconds` is currently `1 day`. Assuming that at some point there are definitely `2 batches` committed simultaneously (severely lowballing it), the challenger can extend each of them for `2 days`
* also note that under the assumption that there is at least `1` new batch per day, this DoS can be prolonged practically forever since all other batches get again prolonged by `2 days` for each newly added batch

Also this issue happens naturally in the following case:

* there are a few batches, one gets unsuccessfully challenged
* after that challenge, the `finalizeTimestamp` has not yet passed
* now a different batch gets challenged, delaying the finalization of the previous batch by `2-7 days` for no reason


### Impact

If done intentionally, permanent DoS, preventing anyone to do withdrawals from L2 to L1, locking funds that are still "in transit".

If it happens naturally as in the second scenario, delaying of withdrawals by a significant amount of time, equivalent to a DoS.


### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Consider changing the `if` statement in `Rollup.sol::challengeState` from `if (i != batchIndex)` to `if (i != batchIndex && !challenges[batchIndex].finished)`, preventing any delays for already proven batches.
