# pause does not handle the timeout challenge

### Summary

The pause does not handle the timeout challenge, which led to the batch that should have been reverted and the sequencer that should have been penalized not being processed, and they may no longer be challengeable.

### Root Cause

During pause, any batch that is challenged will have the challenge canceled.

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-morphl2/blob/main/morph/contracts/contracts/l1/rollup/Rollup.sol#L447-L452
```solidity
            // if challenge exist and not finished yet, return challenge deposit to challenger
            if (inChallenge) {
                batchChallengeReward[challenges[batchChallenged].challenger] += challenges[batchChallenged]
                    .challengeDeposit;
                delete challenges[batchChallenged];
                inChallenge = false;
``` 

However, through `proveState`, it can be determined that as long as no proving is done within the `proofWindow`, the challenger wins, the batch needs to be reverted, and the committer needs to be slashed.
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-morphl2/blob/main/morph/contracts/contracts/l1/rollup/Rollup.sol#L483-L487
```solidity
        // Check for timeout
        if (challenges[_batchIndex].startTime + proofWindow <= block.timestamp) {
            // set status
            challenges[_batchIndex].challengeSuccess = true;
            _challengerWin(_batchIndex, batchDataStore[_batchIndex].signedSequencersBitmap, "Timeout");
```

Therefore, because pause does not determine whether the challenge is timed out, it may result in pause canceling a challenge that could have been won.

### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

Pausing can cancel a challenge that could have been won, requiring the challenger to re-challenge and wait for the proof window, which reduces the security of the protocol.

At the same time, combined with my another vulnerability, "[unpause does not update finalizeTimestamp](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-morphl2-imp0wd3r/issues/2)", the batch may no longer be challenged after unpause, resulting in a wrongly finalized batch.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Determine whether the batch has exceeded the `proofWindow` during `pause`, if it has, execute the `_challengerWin` .
