# Finalisation process of the protocol is significantly slowed down

## Summary

Increasing the challenge period of the un-finalized batches before the challenged batch leads to unnecessary slowing down of the finalization process of the protocol.

## Vulnerability Detail

Challenging the state of committed batches that are not yet finalized increases the `finalizeTimestamp` property of all un-finalized batches except the challenged one. This can lead to unnecessarily slowing down the finalization process of the protocol.

Before the challenge:

```solidity
    [   batch-1,    batch-2,    batch-3,    batch-4 ]
    [               1 day,      1 day       1 day   ] - finalizeTimestamp
    [   finalized,  not,        not,        not     ]
```

After the challenge:

```solidity
    [   batch-1,    batch-2,    batch-3,    batch-4 ]
    [               3 day,      1 day       3 day   ] - finalizeTimestamp
    [   finalized,  not,        challanged, not     ]
```

The challenged batch is batch-3. As we can see the `finalizeTimestamp` of batch-2 was increased by 2 days as per:

Reference to code: [`link`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-morphl2/blob/main/morph/contracts/contracts/l1/rollup/Rollup.sol#L381-L385)

```solidity

    function challengeState(uint64 batchIndex) external payable onlyChallenger nonReqRevert whenNotPaused {
        require(!inChallenge, "already in challenge");
        require(lastFinalizedBatchIndex < batchIndex, "batch already finalized");
        require(committedBatches[batchIndex] != 0, "batch not exist");
        require(challenges[batchIndex].challenger == address(0), "batch already challenged");
        // check challenge window
        require(batchInsideChallengeWindow(batchIndex), "cannot challenge batch outside the challenge window");
        // check challenge amount
        require(msg.value >= IL1Staking(l1StakingContract).challengeDeposit(), "insufficient value");


        batchChallenged = batchIndex;
        challenges[batchIndex] = BatchChallenge(batchIndex, _msgSender(), msg.value, block.timestamp, false, false);
        emit ChallengeState(batchIndex, _msgSender(), msg.value);


@>      for (uint256 i = lastFinalizedBatchIndex + 1; i <= lastCommittedBatchIndex; i++) {
@>          if (i != batchIndex) {
@>              batchDataStore[i].finalizeTimestamp += proofWindow;
@>          }
@>      }


        inChallenge = true;
    }

```

Let's assume that batch-3 was incorrectly challenged and the defender provides valid proof and wins. This means that now 3 days have to pass for batch-2 to be finalized.

There is no need for batch-2 to wait to be finalized when batch-3 is challenged. Only the batches after batch-3 should be slowed down.

It gets worse when we have more distant batches that are challenged. Imagine batch-2 waiting to get passed through its `finalizeTimestamp` to get finalized and then batch 22, 23, and 24 get challenged. Batch-2 now has to wait for 3 * proofWindow more. Then after some time, more batches get committed and again challenged, etc.

The wait time to finalize the first batches can get extremely large for no apparent reason.

## Impact
The performance of the system to finalize batches can get reduced significantly.

## Recommendation

Increase only the `finalizeTimestamp` of the batches after the index of the challanged batch.
