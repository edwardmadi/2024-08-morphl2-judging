# If withdrawalLockBlocks is less than finalizationPeriodSeconds, it can cause incorrect slashing

## Summary and Vulnerability Detail
The sequencer can withdraw their stake from L1Staking immediately after producing a block and submitting a batch. If the batch is challenged and deemed malicious, there is a risk that the sequencer could withdraw their stake and avoid being slashed if withdrawalLockBlocks is less than finalizationPeriodSeconds.

```solidity
    function proveState(
        bytes calldata _batchHeader,
        bytes calldata _aggrProof,
        bytes calldata _kzgDataProof
    ) external nonReqRevert whenNotPaused {
        ...
        if (challenges[_batchIndex].startTime + proofWindow <= block.timestamp) {
            // set status
            challenges[_batchIndex].challengeSuccess = true;
            _challengerWin(_batchIndex, batchDataStore[_batchIndex].signedSequencersBitmap, "Timeout");
        } else {
            _verifyProof(memPtr, _aggrProof, _kzgDataProof);
            // Record defender win
            _defenderWin(_batchIndex, _msgSender(), "Proof success");
        }
    }
```
Now, letâ€™s say that the sequencer does not exist in L1Staking, but there could be a different and new staker at that bitmap position. If there isn't, then in the slashing function, we will end up with a zero address in the sequencer list, which could lead to significant issues.


```solidity
    function slash(uint256 sequencersBitmap) external onlyRollupContract nonReentrant returns (uint256) {
        address[] memory sequencers = getStakersFromBitmap(sequencersBitmap);

        uint256 valueSum;
        for (uint256 i = 0; i < sequencers.length; i++) {
            if (withdrawals[sequencers[i]] > 0) {
                delete withdrawals[sequencers[i]];
                valueSum += stakingValue;
            } else if (!isStakerInDeleteList(sequencers[i])) {
                // If it is the first time to be slashed
                valueSum += stakingValue;
                _removeStaker(sequencers[i]);
                // remove from whitelist
                delete whitelist[sequencers[i]];
                removedList[sequencers[i]] = true;
            }
        }

        uint256 reward = (valueSum * rewardPercentage) / 100;
        slashRemaining += valueSum - reward;
        _transfer(rollupContract, reward);

        emit Slashed(sequencers);
        emit StakersRemoved(sequencers);

        // send message to remove stakers on l2
        _msgRemoveStakers(sequencers);

        return reward;
    }
```
Now, when we have a zero address in the sequencer list, it will enter the else-if block. As a result, this will create an error in accounting for the staking value of other stakers, since the zero address is not a valid staker. We will mistakenly mark the zero address in the removedList and add its stakingValue to valueSum.

If there is a different staker at that position, we will unfairly slash him.

We can also note that our withdrawalLockBlocks time may exceed finalizationPeriodSeconds, but we must keep in mind that finalizationPeriodSeconds can increase due to the challengeState function. For example, if someone challenges a correct batch, we will increase the finalizationTimestamp of every unfinalized batch.



```solidity
    function challengeState(uint64 batchIndex) external payable onlyChallenger nonReqRevert whenNotPaused {
        ...
        for (uint256 i = lastFinalizedBatchIndex + 1; i <= lastCommittedBatchIndex; i++) {
            if (i != batchIndex) {
                batchDataStore[i].finalizeTimestamp += proofWindow;
            }
        }

        inChallenge = true;
    }
```















## Impact
The impact is significant because it can lead to unfair and incorrect slashing.








## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
My recommendation is that we should decrease the finalization of every batch that we increased during challenge creation only when the challenge is proven wrong for that batch.

We should always keep withdrawalLockBlocks time greater than finalizationPeriodSeconds + proofWindow.
