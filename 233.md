# Potential DoS on removeStakers()

### Summary

The removeStakers() function loops through the array of stakers and performs multiple operations that could cause DoS

### Root Cause

The removeStakers() function iterates over a large array of stakers, potentially exceeding the block gas limit and causing a Denial of Service, when the list becomes too large 

### Internal pre-conditions

1. The staker array must contain a large number of entities, increasing the gas cost for iteration 
2. The gas cost of removing stakers exceeds the block gas limit 

### External pre-conditions

1. Malicious actors can register multiple stakers to bloat the staker list
2. Gas prices remain low enough for the attacker to register many accounts without significant costs 

### Attack Path

1. The attacker registers a large number of staker addresses to inflate the staker list 
2. When the owner attempts to call removeStaker(), gas required exceeds the block limit, causing the transaction to revert 
3. The owner is unable to remove stakers, and the protocol becomes inefficient due to bloated operations 

### Impact

- The protocol becomes stuck with an inflation list of stakers, making it impossible or inactive participants 
- Potential loss of $100,000 in lost transaction fees and slower transaction validation 

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

- Use off-chain processing for large data sets
- Implement batched removal, limiting the number of stakers removed per transaction to prevent gas overflow
