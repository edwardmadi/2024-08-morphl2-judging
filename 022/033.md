# External Calls in L1CrossDomainMessenger Allow Reentrancy, Risking Fund Loss and State Inconsistencies

## Summary

The L1CrossDomainMessenger contract contains potential reentrancy vulnerabilities in its `proveAndRelayMessage` and `dropMessage` functions. These vulnerabilities arise from external calls made before state changes are finalized, potentially allowing contracts to re-enter the functions and manipulate the contract's state.

## Vulnerability Detail

In both `proveAndRelayMessage` and `dropMessage` functions, external calls are made to potentially untrusted addresses before critical state changes are completed. This violates the checks-effects-interactions pattern and opens up the possibility for reentrancy attacks.

1. In [proveAndRelayMessage](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-morphl2/blob/main/morph/contracts/contracts/l1/L1CrossDomainMessenger.sol#L122)

- An external call is made to `_to.call{value: _value}(_message)`
- The `finalizedWithdrawals` state is updated after this call

2. In [dropMessage:](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-morphl2/blob/main/morph/contracts/contracts/l1/L1CrossDomainMessenger.sol#L241)

- An external call is made to `IMessageDropCallback(_from).onDropMessage{value: _value}(_message)`
- The `isL1MessageDropped` state is updated before this call, but other state changes could potentially be affected.

## Impact

Maintaining accurate message states and preventing unauthorized withdrawals is crucial for ensuring the integrity and security of cross-chain communication, this reentrancy vulnerability poses a medium or high risk. If exploited, it could lead to:

1. Inconsistent message finalization states
2. Unauthorized message drops or replays
4. Potential drain of contract funds

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
1. Implement the checks-effects-interactions pattern:

- Update all relevant state variables before making external calls

2. Use reentrancy guards:

- Add a `nonReentrant` modifier (e.g., from OpenZeppelin's ReentrancyGuard) to both functions

3. Consider using `transfer()` instead of `call()` for simple ETH transfers, though be aware of its limitations
