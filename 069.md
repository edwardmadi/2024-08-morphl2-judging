# User's remaining fees are lost whenever withdrawing

### Description
[`withdraw`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-morphl2/blob/main/morph/contracts/contracts/l1/staking/L1Staking.sol#L197-L214) function is invoked whenever a user wants to withdraw his staking, this function will invoke `_msgRemoveStakers`. 

Inside `_msgRemoveStakers` `sendMessage` is called, note that there is no option to specify the `refundAddress`.
```javascript
    function _msgRemoveStakers(address[] memory remove) internal {
=>        MESSENGER.sendMessage(
            address(OTHER_STAKING),
            0,
            abi.encodeCall(IL2Staking.removeStakers, (remove)),
            gasLimitRemoveStakers
        );
    }
```

This triggers the `sendMessage` function in the `L1CrossDomainMessenger` contract:

```javascript
    function sendMessage(
        address _to,
        uint256 _value,
        bytes memory _message,
        uint256 _gasLimit
    ) external payable override whenNotPaused {
        _sendMessage(_to, _value, _message, _gasLimit, _msgSender());
    }
```

The `sendMessage` function invokes `_sendMessage`, assigning the `refundAddress` as the `msg.sender`. The `msg.sender` will always be the `L1CrossDomainMessenger` contract itself.

```javascript
   function _sendMessage(
        address _to,
        uint256 _value,
        bytes memory _message,
        uint256 _gasLimit,
        address _refundAddress
    ) internal nonReentrant {
//...Omitted code
        // Refund any remaining fee to the `_refundAddress`
        unchecked {
            uint256 _refund = msg.value - _fee - _value;
            if (_refund > 0) {
                (bool _success, ) = _refundAddress.call{value: _refund}("");
                require(_success, "Failed to refund the fee");
            }
        }
    }
```

If a refund is required, any leftover fee is returned to the `_refundAddress`, which will always be the `L1CrossDomainMessenger` contract itself.

This means that users that might have any remaining fee will not get it back. Instead, the contract will receive it.

Ultimately users lose a part of their funds. 
### Recommendation
Use the other `sendMessage` function which allows to specify your own `_refundAddress`
