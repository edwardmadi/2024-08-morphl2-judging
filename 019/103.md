# Premature token burning in L2 withdrawals

## Summary
The mismatch between gas limit validation on L1 and  gas consumption on L2,  may cause message execution to fails which lead to  token loss or locking, the insufficient validation of user-provided gas limits for cross-chain operations,  in the [withdrawERC1155](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-morphl2/blob/main/morph/contracts/contracts/l2/gateways/L2ERC1155Gateway.sol#L59-L77C6) and [depositERC1155](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-morphl2/blob/main/morph/contracts/contracts/l1/gateways/L1ERC1155Gateway.sol#L63-L81C6) functions,  allows messages to pass gas limit checks on L1 but  fail during execution on L2 due to insufficient gas.

- [L1ERC1155Gateway.sol](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-morphl2/blob/main/morph/contracts/contracts/l1/gateways/L1ERC1155Gateway.sol)

## Vulnerability Detail

In  [_withdrawERC1155](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-morphl2/blob/main/morph/contracts/contracts/l2/gateways/L2ERC1155Gateway.sol#L174-L181C11) the contract burns tokens before ensuring the success of the L1 transaction, risking permanent loss of tokens if the L1 transaction fails.

```solidity
        // 1. burn token
        IMorphERC1155(_token).burn(_sender, _tokenId, _amount);

        // 2. Generate message passed to L1ERC1155Gateway.
        bytes memory _message = abi.encodeCall(
            IL1ERC1155Gateway.finalizeWithdrawERC1155,
            (_l1Token, _token, _sender, _to, _tokenId, _amount)
        );
 ```
Tokens are burned on L2 without confirmation of successful L1 transaction.

## Exploit Scenario

1. A user initiates a withdrawal of ERC1155 tokens from L2 to L1, providing an insufficient gas limit.
2. Tokens are burned on L2.
3. The message fails to execute on L1 due to out-of-gas error.
4. The tokens are permanently lost, as they are burned on L2 but not minted on L1.


## Impact

1. Token Loss in Withdrawals: Tokens are burned on L2 without being minted on L1, resulting in permanent loss.

3. Inconsistent State: Failed messages due to gas issues can lead to inconsistencies between L1 and L2 token balances.

## Recommendations

1. Implement Minimum Gas Checks: set a minimum gas limit for cross-chain operations based on estimated gas costs.

2. Implement a locking mechanism instead of immediate burning for withdrawals.

   ```solidity
       IMorphERC1155(_token).lock(_sender, _tokenId, _amount);
   ```
