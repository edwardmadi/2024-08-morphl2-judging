# _router should be checked.

## Summary
if _router is an invalid address, it could lead to unexpected behavior
## Vulnerability Detail

    function _initialize(address _counterpart, address _router, address _messenger) internal {
        require(_counterpart != address(0), "zero counterpart address");
        require(_messenger != address(0), "zero messenger address");

        ReentrancyGuardUpgradeable.__ReentrancyGuard_init();
        OwnableUpgradeable.__Ownable_init();

        counterpart = _counterpart;
        messenger = _messenger;

        // @note: the address of router could be zero, if this contract is GatewayRouter.
        if (_router != address(0)) {
            router = _router;
        }
    }

## Recommendation
function _initialize(address _counterpart, address _router, address _messenger) internal {
    require(_counterpart != address(0), "zero counterpart address");
    require(_messenger != address(0), "zero messenger address");

    ReentrancyGuardUpgradeable.__ReentrancyGuard_init();
    OwnableUpgradeable.__Ownable_init();

    counterpart = _counterpart;
    messenger = _messenger;

    // Validate router if it is expected to be a contract address
 @>>   if (_router != address(0)) {
        require(_router.code.length > 0, "router must be a contract");
        router = _router;
    }
