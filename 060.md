# After the delegatee is removed, the user's unlockEpoch does not change

### Summary

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-morphl2/blob/main/morph/contracts/contracts/l2/staking/L2Staking.sol#L344-L434

Function `undelegateStake` is used to cancel the delegation for `_msgSender` and set the `unlockEpoch`. When the delegatee is already removed, `unlockEpoch = currentEpoch() + 1`, and when the delegatee is not removed, `unlockEpoch = currentEpoch() + 1 + undelegateLockEpochs`. Then in the `claimUndelegation` function, it will be checked whether unlockEpoch is less than or equal to currentEpoch. 

However, when the delegatee is removed after the user calls `undelegateStake`, the user's unlockEpoch remains unchanged, which means that the user will wait more time before claiming. 

For example, when `currentEpoch = 10`, `undelegateLockEpochs = 10`, user calls `undelegateStake`, so the `unlockEpoch will be 10+1+10 = 21`. Later,  when `currentEpoch = 11`, the delegatee is removed.  At this point users should be allowed to claim at `currentEpoch = 12`. But in fact, users can only claim it after `currentEpoch >= 21`.

It is worth noting that the user cannot call `undelegateStake` again, which makes the user unable to update unlockEpoch.

### Root Cause

After the delegatee is deleted, the user needs to wait more time to claim. At the same time, the user cannot update the unlockEpoch.

### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

1. User calls undelegateStake
2. removeStakers is called.


### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

User has to wait more time to claim.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Allows the user to update unlockEpoch after the delegatee is removed.
