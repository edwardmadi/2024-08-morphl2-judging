# Calculating inflation based on current total supply leads to exponential token supply growth and unintended reward distribution

### Summary

In the `mintInflations` function, the **inflation calculation uses the current total supply (`_totalSupply`) as the base**, resulting in an **exponential increase in the total token supply** over time. This deviates from the intended design where the Morph token supply should increase by **6% of the initial max total supply each year** as staking rewards, as specified in the [Morph Staking System Design Document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1bqV7YgelvSgdnO6wGDbICH85bZW7k7jef4Dg0be2hac/edit). Consequently, **early stakers receive fewer rewards**, and **later stakers receive disproportionately higher rewards**, undermining fairness and the economic model of the staking system. Additionally, using the current total supply means that any change (morph token support burn) of tokens outside of staking rewards will **affect the amount of rewards**, leading to further inconsistencies.

### Root Cause

In the [`mintInflations` function](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-morphl2/blob/main/morph/contracts/contracts/l2/system/MorphToken.sol#L138) of the `MorphToken` contract, the inflation amount is calculated based on the **current total supply**, which includes previously minted inflation tokens and any other tokens burned. This method causes the inflation amount to compound, leading to exponential growth of the token supply rather than a steady 6% annual increase based on the **initial max total supply**.

```solidity
// mintInflations function snippet
uint256 increment = (_totalSupply * rate) / PRECISION;
_inflations[i] = increment;
_mint(DISTRIBUTE_CONTRACT, increment);
```

### Internal pre-conditions

1. **Inflation Rate Settings:**
The contract has inflation rates defined in `_epochInflationRates`, intended to represent an annual 6% increase.3.

2. **Inflation Minting Mechanism:**
The `mintInflations` function is called periodically (per epoch) to mint inflation tokens.

### External pre-conditions

1. **Design Intent as per Documentation:**
   - The [Morph Staking System Design Document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1bqV7YgelvSgdnO6wGDbICH85bZW7k7jef4Dg0be2hac/edit) specifies that the Morph token is inflationary, increasing by **6% of the initial max total supply each year** as staking rewards.

2. **Epoch Timing:**
   - The system operates with defined epochs, and inflation is meant to be calculated and minted at the end of each epoch.

3. **Burning Outside Staking:**
   - The contract allows for burning of tokens for purposes other than staking rewards (e.g., governance decisions, system upgrades), which affects `_totalSupply`.

### Attack Path

1. As `_totalSupply` changed due to previous inflation and other burned outside of staking (e.g., for governance)

2. When `mintInflations` is called, it calculates the inflation increment using the current `_totalSupply`, which grows each time inflation is minted or tokens are burned for other reasons.

### Impact

- **Financial Inequity Among Stakers:**
  - Early stakers are disadvantaged by receiving fewer rewards compared to later stakers.
  - This disincentivizes early participation and undermines trust in the system.

- **Exponential Token Supply Growth:**
  - The total token supply grows much faster than the intended 6% per year, potentially leading to inflationary pressures and token devaluation.

- **Unpredictable Reward Amounts:**
  - Burning activities outside of staking unintentionally affect staking rewards, making them unpredictable and potentially unfair.

- **Misalignment with Design Intent:**
  - The protocol fails to adhere to the economic model outlined in the staking documentation, leading to discrepancies between expected and actual outcomes.

- **Erosion of Participant Trust:**
  - Participants may lose confidence in the protocol's ability to deliver on its promises, affecting user retention and protocol adoption.


### PoC

1. Intended Calculation Using Initial Max Supply

- Initial max supply: 1,000,000 MORPH tokens.
- Intended annual inflation: 6%, or 60,000 tokens per year.
- Daily rate: $\frac{6\%}{365} \approx 0.016438\%$ per day.
- Daily inflation amount: $1,000,000\times0.00016438=$ **164.38 tokens per day**.
- Total inflation over 365 days: $164.38\times365=$ **60,000 tokens**.
- Total supply after 365 days: $1,000,000+60,000=$ **1,060,000 tokens**.
- Last day's increase: **164.38 tokens** (remains constant each day).

2. Current Implementation Using Current Total Supply

- Day 1:
  - Total supply: 1,000,000 tokens.
  - Daily inflation amount: $1,000,000\times0.00016438\approx$ **164.38 tokens**.
  - New total supply: $1,000,000+164.38=$ **1,000,164.38 tokens**.

- Day 2:
  - Total supply: 1,000,164.38 tokens.
  - Daily inflation amount: $1,000,164.38\times0.00016438\approx$ **164.41 tokens**.
  - New total supply: $1,000,164.38+164.41=$ **1,000,328.79 tokens**.

- ...

- Day 365:
  - Total supply: Approximately **1,061,656 tokens**.
  - Daily inflation amount: Previous day's total supply $\times0.00016438\approx$ **174.51 tokens**.
  - Last day's increase: **174.51 tokens** (higher than initial days).

- Total inflation over 365 days:
  - Total supply after 365 days: **1,061,831 tokens**.
  - Total inflation: $1,061,831-1,000,000=$ **61,831 tokens**.
  - Actual annual increase: $\frac{61,831}{1,000,000}\times100\%= 6.1831\% $, exceeding the intended 6%.

Comparison:

- Intended Total Supply after 1 year: **1,060,000 tokens**.
- Current Implementation Total Supply after 1 year: **1,061,831 tokens**.
- PercentageÂ Deviation: 0.1831% tokens extra.

### Mitigation

Maintain a separate variable for calculating staking rewards that is unaffected by other minting or burning activities.
Example:
```solidity
    uint256 public stakingRewardBase = INITIAL_TOTAL_SUPPLY;
```
Change the calculation to:
```solidity
    uint256 increment = (stakingRewardBase * rate) / PRECISION;
```
