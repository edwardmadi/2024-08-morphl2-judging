# Compounded Inflation in `mintInflations` Function

## Summary
In the `mintInflations` function. Specifically, the calculation of the inflation amount per epoch incorrectly uses the `_totalSupply` that is updated during the loop, leading to compounded inflation within the same transaction. This behavior is likely unintended and can cause the token supply to grow exponentially faster than intended.

## Vulnerability Detail
**Total Supply Update:** The `_totalSupply` variable is updated during each iteration of the loop because `_mint` is called, which increases `_totalSupply`.
- **Compounding Effect:** Each subsequent epoch's inflation calculation uses the updated (and increased) `_totalSupply` from the previous iteration. This leads to a compounding effect within a single transaction.
- **Unintended Behavior:** The intended behavior is usually to calculate inflation based on the total supply at the start of each epoch, not to compound within the same transaction.
## Impact
- **Excessive Inflation:** The token supply grows more than intended, which can devalue the token and disrupt the tokenomics.
- **Economic Model Distortion:** The compounded inflation can lead to unforeseen economic consequences, affecting stakeholders and the overall network.
- **Potential Exploitation:** If an entity can trigger multiple epochs' inflation in one transaction, they might exploit this to inflate the supply disproportionately.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
To fix this issue, the inflation calculation should use the initial total supply before any inflation is minted during the transaction.
