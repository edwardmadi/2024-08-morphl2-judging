# Attacker can withdraw Illegitimate challenge rewards despite rollup contract being paused

### Summary

The missing `whenNotPaused` modifier in the `claimReward` function allows an attacker to withdraw challenge rewards even when the contract is paused. This vulnerability means that if an attacker exploits the `proveState` function to submit incorrect proofs and obtain rewards illegitimately, the protocol cannot prevent the attacker from withdrawing these funds during an attack, undermining the emergency pause mechanism designed to halt such exploits.

### Root Cause

In [Rollup.sol#L543](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-morphl2/blob/main/morph/contracts/contracts/l1/rollup/Rollup.sol#L543), the `claimReward` function lacks the `whenNotPaused` modifier, allowing it to be called even when the contract is paused:

```solidity
    function claimReward(address receiver) external {
        uint256 amount = batchChallengeReward[_msgSender()];
        require(amount != 0, "invalid batchChallengeReward");
        delete batchChallengeReward[_msgSender()];
        _transfer(receiver, amount);
    }
```

### Internal pre-conditions

1. The contract is paused using the `pause()` function due to an ongoing exploit or emergency.
2. The attacker has manipulated the `batchChallengeReward` mapping by exploiting the `proveState` function to obtain a reward amount.

### External pre-conditions

- No external conditions are required beyond standard blockchain operation.

### Attack Path

1. **Exploit `proveState` Function**: The attacker calls the `proveState` function, submitting incorrect or malicious proofs to manipulate the protocol into assigning them a challenge reward in `batchChallengeReward[_msgSender()]`.
   
2. **Protocol Attempts to Mitigate**: Detecting irregularities, the protocol owner pauses the contract using the `pause()` function to prevent further exploits.

3. **Bypassing Pause Mechanism**: Despite the contract being paused, the attacker calls the `claimReward` function.

4. **Withdrawal of Illegitimate Rewards**: Because `claimReward` lacks the `whenNotPaused` modifier, the function executes successfully, allowing the attacker to withdraw the illegitimate rewards.

5. **Funds Transferred**: The `_transfer` function is called, transferring the reward amount to the attacker's address, even during the paused state.

### Impact

- **Unauthorized Fund Withdrawal**: The attacker successfully withdraws illegitimate challenge rewards during a paused state, leading to a loss of funds for the protocol or other users.
  
- **Ineffective Emergency Measures**: The protocol's ability to halt operations during an emergency is compromised, as attackers can still withdraw funds despite the contract being paused.

- **Increased Exploit Window**: The inability to prevent reward claims during a paused state extends the window of opportunity for attackers to exploit the system and drain funds.

### PoC

While a full Proof of Concept is not strictly necessary, the following example illustrates the issue:

1. **Setup**: Deploy the `Rollup` contract and simulate normal operations.

2. **Exploit Proof Submission**: The attacker crafts and submits incorrect proofs via the `proveState` function to manipulate `batchChallengeReward` and assign themselves a significant reward.

3. **Pause Contract**: The protocol owner detects unusual activity and pauses the contract using the `pause()` function to prevent further exploits.

4. **Claim Reward During Pause**: The attacker calls `claimReward(attackerAddress)` while the contract is paused.

5. **Observe Transfer**: Despite the contract being paused, the reward amount is transferred to the attacker's address, confirming the vulnerability.

### Mitigation

Add the `whenNotPaused` modifier to the `claimReward` function to ensure it cannot be called when the contract is paused:

```solidity
function claimReward(address receiver) external whenNotPaused {
    // existing code
}
```
