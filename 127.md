# Delegator could be disincentivised to delegate to a staker that is on the back of the staker addresses array

## Summary
Delegators could prefer stakers based on the associated required gas they need to pay in order to delegate to them.

## Vulnerability Detail

A Morph token holder can delegate his tokens to a staker via [`L2Staking.delegateStake()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-morphl2/blob/main/morph/contracts/contracts/l2/staking/L2Staking.sol#L284). If the reward have started his call will sort all staker addresses from the 0 index to the index of the delegatee. 

The max amount of stakers is 255 so a delegator could be disincentivised to choose a delegator that is at the last indexes of the array (lets say the 255th place) because this could mean paying a large amount of gas.

In this case the first stakers are more likely to retain their first positions and attract more delegations in comparison to the current last stakers.

## Impact

Last stakers in the array could receive less or no delegations due to the associated with them expensive computation that must be paid by the delegator.
