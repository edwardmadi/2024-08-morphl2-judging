# revertBatch incorrectly reset inChallenge.

### Summary

`revertBatch` mistakenly reset `inChallenge`, resulting in `inChallenge` becoming false when there are incomplete challenges. This can lead to the following two outcomes:
1. Allowing two challenged batches to exist simultaneously, which is not in line with the contract's design.
2. If a pause is executed later, the deposit for the incomplete challenge will be lost.

### Root Cause

In `revertBatch`, if `challenges[_batchIndex].finished` is false, `inChallenge` will be set to false.

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-morphl2/blob/main/morph/contracts/contracts/l1/rollup/Rollup.sol#L344-L348
```solidity
            // if challenge exist and not finished yet, return challenge deposit to challenger
            if (!challenges[_batchIndex].finished) {
                batchChallengeReward[challenges[_batchIndex].challenger] += challenges[_batchIndex].challengeDeposit;
                inChallenge = false;
            }
```

Since the initial value of `challenges[_batchIndex].finished` is false, as long as there is a batch without a successful challenge, `inChallenge` will ultimately be false.

The issue here is that the target executed by `revertBatch` may not include the batch being challenged. For example:
1. Assume the `lastFinalizedBatch` index is 1, and indices 2, 3, 4, and 5 are all committed batches.
2. The owner discovers that 3-5 are incorrect and executes `revertBatch`.
3. Before or at the same time, index 2 is challenged. Normally, reverting 3-5 should not affect the challenge of 2 (so this vuln is not admin wrong input), but this vulnerability causes `inChallenge` to be set to false while 2 is still being challenged.

The first possible result is that there will be two challenged batches existing simultaneously, which does not comply with the contract's design.
Since challengeState ensures that only one challenge exists at a time through inChallenge, resetting it means a new one can exist.
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-morphl2/blob/main/morph/contracts/contracts/l1/rollup/Rollup.sol#L367-L371
```solidity
    function challengeState(uint64 batchIndex) external payable onlyChallenger nonReqRevert whenNotPaused {
        require(!inChallenge, "already in challenge");
        require(lastFinalizedBatchIndex < batchIndex, "batch already finalized");
        require(committedBatches[batchIndex] != 0, "batch not exist");
        require(challenges[batchIndex].challenger == address(0), "batch already challenged");
``` 

The second possible outcome is that when executing pause, if `inChallenge` is true, the deposit will be returned, erroneously resetting `inChallenge`, causing the challenger to lose the deposit that should be returned.

```solidity
            // if challenge exist and not finished yet, return challenge deposit to challenger
            if (inChallenge) {
                batchChallengeReward[challenges[batchChallenged].challenger] += challenges[batchChallenged]
                    .challengeDeposit;
                delete challenges[batchChallenged];
                inChallenge = false;
```
