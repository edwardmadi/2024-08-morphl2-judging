# Challenger will lose the challenge deposit when the batch is reverted and contract is paused

### Summary

When the batch that the challenger is not challenged and it is reverted and then the contract is paused the challengers deposit will be lost

### Root Cause


When `revertBatch` is called for a future batch at [Rollup.sol:345](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-morphl2/blob/98e0ec4c5bbd0b28f3d3a9e9159d1184bc45b38d/morph/contracts/contracts/l1/rollup/Rollup.sol#L345-L348), and there is a challenged batch preceding the reverted batch, the `inChallenge` storage variable is mistakenly set to `false`, even though the challenged batch has not been reverted. If the contract is paused after this, but before the challenge is successfully resolved, the challenger's deposit will not be refunded, as `inChallenge` is set to `false` despite an ongoing challenge. If the paused period exceeds the challenge window, the challenger risks losing their deposit [Rollup.sol:448](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-morphl2/blob/98e0ec4c5bbd0b28f3d3a9e9159d1184bc45b38d/morph/contracts/contracts/l1/rollup/Rollup.sol#L448-L453).


### Internal pre-conditions

1. Admin needs to call `revertBatch` on a future ahead batch than the challenged batch
2. Admin needs to call `setPause`

### External pre-conditions

None needed

### Attack Path

1. There are some batches to be finalized and there is a challenge on the batch "k"
2. Admin calls `revertBatch` for "k + x" which is a batch that is further than the challenged batch
3. Admin calls `setPause` function which mistakenly skips the ongoing challenged deposit

### Impact

Challenger loses its challenge deposit

### PoC

None needed

### Mitigation

```solidity
+ if (batchInChallenge(_batchIndex)) {
      batchChallengeReward[challenges[_batchIndex].challenger] += challenges[_batchIndex].challengeDeposit;
      inChallenge = false;
  }
```
