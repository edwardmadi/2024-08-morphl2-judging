# Unrestricted withdrawal mechanism

### Summary

The claimWithdrawl function allows a staker to withdraw funds immediately after the withdrawal lock period ends, but the lock period is hardcoded

### Root Cause

The claimWithdrawal function allows immediate withdrawal after the lock period ends. A malicious actor could manipulate the timing to front-run legitimate withdrawals 

### Internal pre-conditions

1. The withdrawal lock period is hardcoded
2. A malicious actor knows exactly when the lock expires 

### External pre-conditions

1. The attacker can manipulate block timingâ€™s to front-run legitimate users 

### Attack Path

1. The attacker monitors the block timing and initiates a withdrawal as soon as the lock expires 
2. They drain the funds before legitimate users can react

### Impact

Users lose their staked funds as the attacker front-runs the withdrawal process. For example, if the total stake is 1000 ETH, the attacker could withdraw all funds before others

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Implement a randomised delay or use a time stamp-based lock rather than block-based timing to reduce predictability
