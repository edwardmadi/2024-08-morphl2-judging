# Unchecked Return Value in `transferAndCall` Function Allowing Silent Transfer Failures

## Summary
The [transferAndCall](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-morphl2/blob/main/morph/contracts/contracts/libraries/token/MorphStandardERC20.sol#L58) function in the `MorphStandardERC20` smart contract fails to verify the return value of the [ERC20Upgradeable.transfer](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-morphl2/blob/main/morph/contracts/contracts/libraries/token/MorphStandardERC20.sol#L59) call. This omission leads to scenarios where token transfers can **silently fail without reverting the transaction**. As a result, the function continues its execution under the false assumption that the transfer was successful.

## Vulnerability Detail
The `MorphStandardERC20` contract implements a key feature of **ERC677,** specifically the [transferAndCall](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-morphl2/blob/main/morph/contracts/contracts/libraries/token/MorphStandardERC20.sol#L58) function. This function is an implementation of the ERC677 token standard, which extends ERC20 to allow token transfers to trigger a function call on the receiving contract.

```solidity
function transferAndCall(address receiver, uint256 amount, bytes calldata data) external returns (bool success) {
    ERC20Upgradeable.transfer(receiver, amount);
    if (isContract(receiver)) {
        contractFallback(receiver, amount, data);
    }
    return true;
}
```
**Key points:**

- It allows tokens to be transferred to a contract.
- The function first performs a standard ERC20 transfer.
- It then checks if the receiver is a contract.


If so, it calls [contractFallback](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-morphl2/blob/main/morph/contracts/contracts/libraries/token/MorphStandardERC20.sol#L61), which invokes the [onTokenTransfer](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-morphl2/blob/main/morph/contracts/contracts/libraries/token/MorphStandardERC20.sol#L68) function on the receiving contract. The contract focuses on the functional aspect of ERC677 rather than full compliance with the standard.

The `transferAndCall` function in the **MorphStandardERC20 smart contract** fails to verify the return value of the `ERC20Upgradeable.transfer` call. This omission leads to scenarios where token transfers can silently fail without reverting the transaction. As a result, the function continues its execution under the false assumption that the transfer was successful.

```solidity 
ERC20Upgradeable.transfer(receiver, amount);
```

 This line attempts to transfer `amount` tokens from the caller to the `receiver`. The `transfer` function returns a boolean (**true** for success, **false** for failure). The function always returns true, indicating a successful operation. In this, the `return` value of the `transfer` function is not captured or checked. 

If the transfer fails (e.g., due to insufficient balance), `transfer` returns `false`.
Since the return value is ignored, the function does not detect whether the transfer succeeded or failed.

```solidity
return true;
```

No matter what happens with the `transfer`, the function always returns `true`. This misleads users and integrators into believing that the transfer was successful, even when it wasn't.

## PoC
Alice has 100 tokens, while Bob has 0 tokens. 
When Alice tries to transfer 200 tokens to Bob using the `transferAndCall` function with the command
```solidity
await token.transferAndCall(bob, 200, "0x", { from: alice });
```
The expected outcome is that the transfer should fail since Alice only has 100 tokens. 

In this case, the function should revert or return false to indicate the failure. However, the actual behavior shows that the transfer function fails and returns false, but this return value is ignored, causing the contract to execute `contractFallback` anyway. As a result, the function returns true despite the transfer failure. Consequently, Alice's balance remains at 100 tokens, Bob's balance remains at 0 tokens, and the misleading success message indicates that a transfer occurred successfully.

This is how the Output shows:

```solidity
Alice attempts to transfer 200 tokens to Bob using transferAndCall.
transferAndCall transaction returned: true
Alice's balance: 100
Bob's balance: 0
```

## Impact

1. Users might think they've successfully transferred tokens when they actually haven't, which can cause financial issues and lead to a loss of trust.
2. Attackers could create contracts that take advantage of this behavior, allowing them to change contract states or get around the intended rules.
3. Decentralized Applications (DApps) and other smart contracts that depend on the successful execution of `transferAndCall` may behave unexpectedly or fail, which can disrupt user experiences and functionalities.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

1. Replaces the direct `ERC20Upgradeable.transfer` call with `SafeERC20.safeTransfer`


```solidity 
 import "@openzeppelin/contracts/token/ERC20/utils/SafeERC20.sol";
   using SafeERC20 for IERC20;
   IERC20(address(this)).safeTransfer(receiver, amount);
```

2. Uses `require` to ensure that the transfer was successful, reverting the transaction if it wasn't.

```solidity
     function transferAndCall(address receiver, uint256 amount, bytes calldata data) external returns (bool success) {
         bool sent = ERC20Upgradeable.transfer(receiver, amount);
         require(sent, "Token transfer failed");
         if (isContract(receiver)) {
             contractFallback(receiver, amount, data);
         }
         return true;
     }
```
