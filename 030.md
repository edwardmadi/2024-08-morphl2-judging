# Unrestricted Commission Rate Changes Allow Exploitation of Delegators

## Summary
The `setCommissionRate` function in the `L2Staking` contract allows stakers to change their commission rates without any restrictions on frequency or magnitude, potentially leading to sudden and unexpected changes that can exploit delegators.

## Vulnerability Detail
The root cause of this is the lack of constraints on how often or by how much a staker can change their commission rate. This allows for abrupt changes that can negatively impact delegators who are not aware of the change.
```solidity
File: d:\project\MorphL2\MorphL2\contracts\l2\staking\L2Staking.sol
206:     function setCommissionRate(uint256 commission) external onlyStaker {
207:@=>      require(commission <= 20, "invalid commission");
208:         commissions[_msgSender()] = commission;
209:         uint256 epochEffective = rewardStarted ? currentEpoch() + 1 : 0;
210:         emit CommissionUpdated(_msgSender(), commission, epochEffective);
211:     }
```
• Problematic Row: There are no additional constraints other than `require(commission <= 20, "invalid commission");`, which allows drastic changes in one step.
• Malicious User Exploitation: A malicious stakeholder could suddenly increase their commission by 20% after getting a lot of delegations, maximizing their profits while the delegators are unaware of the change.

## Impact
- Delegators receive significantly less reward than expected if a staker suddenly increases their commission rate.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
- Introduce a limit on how frequently and by how much a staker can change their commission rate.
- Implement a delay or notification period before a new commission rate takes effect, giving delegators time to react or adjust their stakes if necessary.
- Maintain a history of commission rate changes for each staker, allowing delegators to make informed decisions based on past behavior.
