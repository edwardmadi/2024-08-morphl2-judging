# Revert request will occupy the challenge window.

### Summary

Revert request will occupy the challenge window.

There is a certain time interval from the initiation of the revert request to the actual execution of the revert by the owner, during which challenges cannot be made. This makes batches that could have been challenged unable to be challenged during this period, rendering part of the challenge window ineffective.

### Root Cause

When the challenge is successful, the `revertReqIndex` will be recorded, and then the owner will execute `revertBatch` to eliminate this record.

```solidity
    function _challengerWin(uint256 batchIndex, uint256 sequencersBitmap, string memory _type) internal {
        revertReqIndex = batchIndex;
``` 

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-morphl2/blob/main/morph/contracts/contracts/l1/rollup/Rollup.sol#L351-L353
```solidity
            if (revertReqIndex > 0 && _batchIndex == revertReqIndex) {
                revertReqIndex = 0;
            }
``` 

When `revertReqIndex` is present, challenges to other batches cannot be initiated.

```solidity
    function challengeState(uint64 batchIndex) external payable onlyChallenger nonReqRevert whenNotPaused {
``` 

There is a certain time interval from the initiation of the revert request to the actual execution of the revert by the owner, during which challenges cannot be made. This makes batches that could have been challenged unable to be challenged during this period, rendering part of the challenge window ineffective.

For example:
1. Suppose the `lastFinalizedIndex` is 1, and then the committed batch indices are 2, 3, 4, 5.
2. The batch with index 3 is successfully challenged, and assume the owner executes `revertBatch` after 10 blocks, reverting batches 3-5.
3. During these 10 blocks, the batch with index 2, although not finalized, cannot be challenged, i.e., the time it can be challenged is reduced by 10 blocks.
4. The reduction in time ultimately available for challenges diminishes the security of the protocol.

### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1. Suppose the `lastFinalizedIndex` is 1, and then the committed batch indices are 2, 3, 4, 5.
2. The batch with index 3 is successfully challenged, and assume the owner executes `revertBatch` after 10 blocks, reverting batches 3-5.
3. During these 10 blocks, the batch with index 2, although not finalized, cannot be challenged, i.e., the time it can be challenged is reduced by 10 blocks.
4. The reduction in time ultimately available for challenges diminishes the security of the protocol.

### Impact

The time that a batch can be challenged is reduced, decreasing the security of the protocol.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Record the time from the initiation of the request to execution, and extend the finalize time of all unfinalized items accordingly in `revertBatch`.
