# Incorrect implementation of the onDropMessage function in the L1ReverseCustomGateway contract

## Summary and Vulnerability Detail
In the L1ReverseCustomGateway, tokens are burned during deposit and minted during the finalizeWithdrawERC20 process.

For failed deposits, we have the onDropMessage function to allow the user to retrieve their tokens.
```solidity
    function onDropMessage(bytes calldata _message) external payable virtual onlyInDropContext nonReentrant {
        // _message should start with 0x8431f5c1  =>  finalizeDepositERC20(address,address,address,address,uint256,bytes)
        require(bytes4(_message[0:4]) == IL2ERC20Gateway.finalizeDepositERC20.selector, "invalid selector");

        // decode (token, receiver, amount)
        (address _token, , address _receiver, , uint256 _amount, ) = abi.decode(
            _message[4:],
            (address, address, address, address, uint256, bytes)
        );

        // do dome check for each custom gateway
        _beforeDropMessage(_token, _receiver, _amount);

        IERC20Upgradeable(_token).safeTransfer(_receiver, _amount);

        emit RefundERC20(_token, _receiver, _amount);
    }
```
It will not work now because instead of using safeTransfer we should mint the tokens to _receiver.

## Impact
The impact is high because the dropMessage functionality will never work, preventing the user from recovering their tokens.


## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
My recommendation is to use `IMorphERC20Upgradeable(_token).mint(_receiver, _amount)` instead of transferring the tokens.
