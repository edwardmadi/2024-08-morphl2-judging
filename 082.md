# `L2Staking::removeStakers(..)` will revert when removing the last staker in the `stakerAddresses` list

### Summary

Due to a logical flaw in the `L2Staking.removeStakers(...)`, it will be impossible to remove the last staker in the `stakerAddresses` array thus leading to a situation whereby a staker may not be able to process the withdrawal of their funds

### Root Cause

When [`L2Staking.removeStakers(...)`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-morphl2/blob/main/morph/contracts/contracts/l2/staking/L2Staking.sol#L173-L185) is called to remove a staker,
- if the staker being removed is 
    - the last element in the `stakerAddresses` array
    - or the only element in the `stakerAddresses` array,

the function will revert because the inner loop on L183 attempt to access an element that does not yet exist (an out of bound index) in the `stakerAddresses` array 


```solidity
File: L2Staking.sol
173:     function removeStakers(address[] calldata remove) external onlyOtherStaking {
174:         bool updateSequencerSet = false;
175:         for (uint256 i = 0; i < remove.length; i++) {
176:             if (stakerRankings[remove[i]] <= latestSequencerSetSize) {
177:                 updateSequencerSet = true;
178:             }
179: 
180:             if (stakerRankings[remove[i]] > 0) {
181:                 // update stakerRankings
182:     @>          for (uint256 j = stakerRankings[remove[i]] - 1; j < stakerAddresses.length - 1; j++) {
183:     @>              stakerAddresses[j] = stakerAddresses[j + 1];
184:                     stakerRankings[stakerAddresses[j]] -= 1;
185:                 } 
SNIP      .............

202:     }

```

To Illustrate lets assume there are 3 stakers in the `stakerAddresses` array (`s1`, `s2` and `s3` with index 0, 1 and 2 respectively)
- `stakerAddresses.length` = 3
- when `s3` was [added](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-morphl2/blob/main/morph/contracts/contracts/l2/staking/L2Staking.sol#L160-L161), `stakerRankings[s3]` = `stakerAddresses.length` = 3
- remove  staker `s3` => `remove.length` = 1
```solidity  
182:     @>          for (uint256 j = stakerRankings[remove[i]] - 1; j < stakerAddresses.length - 1; j++) 
```
- the loop on L182 starts from `j` = 2 and breaks immediately after the first iteration because `j` < 2
- L183 evaluates to `stakerAddresses[2]` = `stakerAddresses[3]`. 


**The problem is that L183 tries to access an element that is out of bound (in this scenario, there is no element at index 3)** in the `stakerAddresses` array at this time and as such the call will revert with an array out of bound error

Also, this can prevent sequencers from withdrawing their stake because as shown below and given the preconditions explained above, the `slash(...)` call on L1 will revert since it makes a call to [`_msgRemoveStakers(...)`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-morphl2/blob/main/morph/contracts/contracts/l1/staking/L1Staking.sol#L197-L214) to remove the slashed sequencer on L2

```solidity
File: L1Staking.sol
196:     function withdraw() external {
197:         require(isActiveStaker(_msgSender()), "only active staker");
SNIP      .........

210: 
211:         // send message to remove staker on l2
212:   @>    _msgRemoveStakers(remove);
213:     }
```

### Internal pre-conditions

- The staker being removed is the last on the `stakerAddresses` array
- or There is only one staker in the `stakerAddresses` array

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

- This can lead to a situation where a staker's is not able to call `withdraw()` and as such their funds are stuck in the `L1Staking` contract without a way to withdraw
- This can also block sequencers from getting slashed (because it calls `_msgRemoveStakers(...)`)


### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Modifiy the `L2Staking.removeStakers(...)` function to ensure that the it doesn't try to access an element that is not in the `stakerAddresses` array.
