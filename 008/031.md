# Inefficient and Unvalidated Reward Distribution Initialization

## Summary
The `startReward` function in the `L2Staking` contract lacks proper validation and uses an inefficient sorting algorithm, leading to unfair reward distribution and operational delays.

## Vulnerability Detail
The function it does not validate the consistency and correctness of delegation data before sorting. Additionally, the use of insertion sort is inefficient for large datasets, which can delay the reward distribution process.

252:     function startReward() external onlyOwner {
253:         require(block.timestamp >= rewardStartTime, "can't start before reward start time");
254:         require(candidateNumber > 0, "none candidate");

261:                 if (stakerDelegations[stakerAddresses[i]] > stakerDelegations[stakerAddresses[j]]) {

264:                     stakerAddresses[i] = tmp;
265:                 }

- Problematic Rows: Use of insertion sort in the sorting section, and lack of validation of delegate data before sorting.
- Root Cause: No checks to ensure that delegate data is correct and consistent before starting the sorting and reward distribution process. Use of insertion sort can also lead to inefficiencies, especially with large stakers.

## Impact
Stakers with inaccurate delegation data may receive incorrect rewards.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
- Before starting the sorting and distribution of rewards, make sure all delegate data has been validated and synchronized.
- Replace insertion sort with a more efficient sorting algorithm, such as quicksort or mergesort, to address performance issues with large staker lists.
