# startReward can revert or be extremely expensive

## Summary

StartReward's sorting algorithm can result in DOS of the function or in a very expensive computation due to the large amount of stakers that could be processed.

## Vulnerability Detail

[`L2Staking.startReward()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-morphl2/blob/main/morph/contracts/contracts/l2/staking/L2Staking.sol#L252-L275) uses insertion sort algorithm to sort all staker addresses from the ones with the biggest delegation amounts to the lowest. On L1 the stakers array is limited to 255 so on L2 there won't me more than that.

If we assume there are 255 stakers addresses before the owner calls [`startReward()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-morphl2/blob/main/morph/contracts/contracts/l2/staking/L2Staking.sol#L252-L275) then we can expect this function to be extremely expensive or prevent the owner from successfully starting the rewards because the call could exceed the block gas limit.

I created a contract that we can use in remix in order to test the aprox gas required for this computation:

```solidity
    contract Stakers {
        address[] public stakerAddresses;
        mapping(address => uint) public stakerRankings;
        mapping(address => uint) public stakerDelegations;
        uint delegationCounter;
        uint counter;

        function addStaker(uint times) external returns(uint) {
            for (uint i = 0; i < times; i++) {
                address x = address(uint160(++counter));
                stakerAddresses.push(x);
                stakerRankings[x] = stakerAddresses.length;
                stakerDelegations[x] = ++delegationCounter;
            }

            return stakerAddresses.length;
        }

        function addStakerNoDelegation(uint times) external returns(uint) {
            for (uint i = 0; i < times; i++) {
                address x = address(uint160(++counter));
                stakerAddresses.push(x);
                stakerRankings[x] = stakerAddresses.length;
                stakerDelegations[x] = 0;
            }

            return stakerAddresses.length;
        }

        function startReward() external {
            for (uint256 i = 1; i < stakerAddresses.length; i++) {
                for (uint256 j = 0; j < i; j++) {
                    if (stakerDelegations[stakerAddresses[i]] > stakerDelegations[stakerAddresses[j]]) {
                        address tmp = stakerAddresses[j]; // Aleks
                        stakerAddresses[j] = stakerAddresses[i]; // Nino
                        stakerAddresses[i] = tmp; // Aleks
                    }
                }
            }

            // update rankings
            for (uint256 i = 0; i < stakerAddresses.length; i++) {
                stakerRankings[stakerAddresses[i]] = i + 1;
            }
        }
    }
```

Here are the results from the tests I made:

- All 255 stakers have increasing delegation amounts. The sorting costs of all 255 costs: *101_671_046 gas*
- First 100 have increasing delegation amounts and the rest 155 have 0: *52_125_935 gas*
- 10 stakers spread out evenly over 255 stakers have delegation amounts, the rest have 0: *42_713_636 gas*
- The first staker has delegation amount, the rest 244 are with 0: *42_496_698 gas*
- Only the last staker out of all 255 have a delegation amount: *42_511_329 gas*

The current average block gas limit of Ethereum is 30_000_000 gas. I assume MorphL2 has similar block gas limit (even though in the docs is stated that it will be less).


## Impact

StartReward function will be either very expensive or it will revert due to the big amount of gas needed to sort all stakers.

## Recommendation

Avoid looping multiple times over a large amount of items. It is recommended to do such computations off-chain or avoiding them all together.
