# The `L2Staking.sol:startReward` function can exceed the blockgas limit  leading to DOS.

### Summary

The function contains a loop that does insertion sort on the Stakers array, the issue here is that insertion sort worst case scenario has a time complexity of O(n2). So for stakers array of length 256, the total number of operations will be 256 * 256 = 65,536. Each operation in the loop will cost roughly 4000 gas, so the gas cost will be 65536 * 4000 = 262,144,000. That is above the total block gas limit of most chains is around 30,000,000 gas.

### Root Cause

The root cause of this issue is the nested loop in the `startReward` function. The loop performs an insertion sort which on average or worst-case scenario has a time complexity of O(n2).

            for (uint256 j = 0; j < i; j++) {
                if (stakerDelegations[stakerAddresses[i]] > stakerDelegations[stakerAddresses[j]]) {
                    address tmp = stakerAddresses[j];
                    stakerAddresses[j] = stakerAddresses[i];
                    stakerAddresses[i] = tmp;
                }
            }
        }
        // update rankings
        for (uint256 i = 0; i < stakerAddresses.length; i++) {
            stakerRankings[stakerAddresses[i]] = i + 1;
        }

        // update sequencer set
        _updateSequencerSet();
