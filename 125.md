# `setPause` leave batch unproven, could potentially make it to finalization

## Summary


`setPause` function delete a challenge, but leave the challenged batch unproven.
## Vulnerability Detail
When owner call `setPause` function due to a exploit/upgrade. The function pauses the contract's function but then executes some code:
```solidity
    /// @notice Pause the contract
    /// @param _status The pause status to update.
    function setPause(bool _status) external onlyOwner {
        if (_status) {
            _pause();
            // if challenge exist and not finished yet, return challenge deposit to challenger
            if (inChallenge) {
                batchChallengeReward[challenges[batchChallenged].challenger] += challenges[batchChallenged]
                    .challengeDeposit;
                delete challenges[batchChallenged];
                inChallenge = false;
            }
        } else {
            _unpause();
        }
    }
```
It first checks if `(inChallenge)` is set to `true` meaning a challenge is currently ongoing and the challenged batch still didn't pass the zk-circuit and checking it's legitimacy. Then it refund the challenger's bond back to the challenge initiator. After it immediately deletes the challenge. And set the `inChallenge` variable to `false`. 

The issue here is that the challenger had previously initiated a challenge because it was a suspicious batch (incorrect data, wrong L2 state, etc). But the pause function is deleting the challenge and leaving the batch unproven that could potentially make it to the finalization step and would lead to dangerous results.
## Impact
- A batch with incorrect/malicious data could make it to finalization step
  - financial losses
  - L2 state compromised
  - ...

## Tool used
Manual Review
## Recommendation
The state of the batch must be explicitly added to the pending revert request (`revertReqIndex`) because not proved (while went on challenge) thus not trustworthy.
```diff
    /// @notice Pause the contract
    /// @param _status The pause status to update.
    function setPause(bool _status) external onlyOwner {
        if (_status) {
            _pause();
            // if challenge exist and not finished yet, return challenge deposit to challenger
            if (inChallenge) {
                batchChallengeReward[challenges[batchChallenged].challenger] += challenges[batchChallenged]
                    .challengeDeposit;
+               revertReqIndex = challenges[batchChallenged].batchIndex;
                delete challenges[batchChallenged];
                inChallenge = false;
            }
        } else {
            _unpause();
        }
    }
```
