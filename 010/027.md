# After being removed, the staker cannot claim the deserved commission before.

### Summary

After being removed, the staker cannot claim the deserved commission before.

The commission is to be issued as confirmed, even if it is no longer the staker who has the right to claim the previously earned rewards. Also, if the claim cannot be made, the distribution data cannot be deleted, which does not meet the contract's function.

Although a staker can claim before actively removing, i.e., withdrawing, firstly, it is not mandatory, and secondly, apart from actively removing, there are cases of passive removal, i.e., being removed by the owner or being slashed, which cannot be anticipated and claimed in advance, leading to the loss of deserved rewards.

### Root Cause

`claimCommission` is limited to `onlyStaker`.

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-morphl2/blob/main/morph/contracts/contracts/l2/staking/L2Staking.sol#L215-L217
```solidity
    function claimCommission(uint256 targetEpochIndex) external onlyStaker nonReentrant {
        IDistribute(DISTRIBUTE_CONTRACT).claimCommission(_msgSender(), targetEpochIndex);
    }
``` 

The commission is confirmed by oracle for the rewards of the previous epochs.

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-morphl2/blob/main/morph/contracts/contracts/l2/staking/Record.sol#L204-L207
```solidity
                // compute rewards per sequencer
                uint256 reward = (inflationAmount * _rewardEpochs[i].sequencerRatios[j]) / PRECISION;
                commissions[j] = (reward * _rewardEpochs[i].sequencerCommissions[j]) / 100;
                delegatorRewards[j] = reward - commissions[j];
``` 

Since it is a reward from a past epoch, even if he is no longer a staker now, he still has the right to claim past rewards.

Even if he is removed because of a slash, the value he needs to be deducted is the stake's value, and he should not be prevented from claiming the rewards he previously earned.

Additionally, it is stated in both `claim` and `claimCommision` that if `remainsNumber` and `commissionAmount` are 0, meaning both the delegator and delegatee have claimed, the data in `distributions` should be deleted.

Unable to `claimCommision` causing `commissionAmount` not to become 0, data in `distributions` cannot be deleted, which does not comply with the design of the contract.

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-morphl2/blob/main/morph/contracts/contracts/l2/staking/Distribute.sol#L233-L236
```solidity
            // if all delegators claimed, delete distribution
            if (distributions[delegatee][i].delegators.length() > 0 && distributions[delegatee][i].remainsNumber == 0) {
                delete distributions[delegatee][i];
            }
``` 

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-morphl2/blob/main/morph/contracts/contracts/l2/staking/Distribute.sol#L363-L370
```solidity
            // update distribution info, delete if all claimed
            distributions[delegatee][i].remainsNumber--;
            if (
                distributions[delegatee][i].remainsNumber == 0 && // all delegators claimed
                distributions[delegatee][i].commissionAmount == 0 // delegatee claimed
            ) {
                delete distributions[delegatee][i];
            }
```

### Impact

After being removed, the staker cannot claim the deserved commission before.

Although a staker can claim before actively removing, i.e., withdrawing, firstly, it is not mandatory, and secondly, apart from actively removing, there are cases of passive removal, i.e., being removed by the owner or being slashed, which cannot be anticipated and claimed in advance, leading to the loss of deserved rewards.

Unable to `claimCommision` causing `commissionAmount` not to become 0, data in `distributions` cannot be deleted, which does not comply with the design of the contract.

### PoC

### Mitigation

Remove the restriction on `onlyStaker`, as people who have never received rewards will not have `commissionAmount`, and executing `claimCommission` will have no effect.
