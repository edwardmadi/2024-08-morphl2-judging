# When a staker is removed, the previous unclaimed commission rewards will not be available for claiming.

### Summary

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-morphl2/blob/main/morph/contracts/contracts/l2/staking/L2Staking.sol#L206-L217

Stakers can set the commission percentage and claim the distributed rewards through `claimCommission`. However, when the staker is removed, the modifier `onlyStaker` will return false, making the previous rewards unclaimable.

### Root Cause

In `L2Staking.sol#claimCommission`, only currently existing stakers can claim rewards, which results in removed stakers being unable to claim previous rewards.

### Internal pre-conditions

1. removeStakers is being called.

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1. The staker calls etCommissionRate
2. After staker is removed,  the staker wants to call claimCommission, but reverted.

### Impact

The removed stakers can not claim the commission rewards.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

When stakers are removed, the commission rewards should be distributed immediately.
