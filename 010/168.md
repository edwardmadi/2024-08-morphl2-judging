# Stakers lose their commission if they unstake as they cannot claim their pending rewards anymore after unstaking

### Summary

Once a staker unstakes or gets removed, they permanently lose access to all their accrued commissions.

This is a problem as it can either happen mistakenly or if the staker gets removed by an admin or slashed. However even in that case, they should still be able to claim their previously accrued rewards since they did not act negatively during that period.


### Root Cause

[`L2Staking.sol::claimCommission`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-morphl2/blob/98e0ec4c5bbd0b28f3d3a9e9159d1184bc45b38d/morph/contracts/contracts/l2/staking/L2Staking.sol#L215) has the `onlyStaker` modifier, making it only callable by stakers.


### Internal pre-conditions

None

### External pre-conditions

None

### Attack Path

Issue path in this case

* Staker stakes and accrues commissions over a few epochs
* Now either the staker unstakes or gets removed forcibly by the admin
* The staker has now lost access to all previously accrued rewards


### Impact

Loss of unclaimed rewards


### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Consider removing the `onlyStaker` modifier and allow anyone to call it. This should not be a problem since normal users do not have any claimable commission anyways except if they were a staker before.
