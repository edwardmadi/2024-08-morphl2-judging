# Lack of Fallback Mechanism in ETH Transfer

## Summary
The `_transfer` function in the `L1Staking` contract lacks a fallback mechanism to handle failed ETH transfers. This can result in funds being stuck in the contract if the transfer to the recipient fails.

## Vulnerability Detail
The vulnerability arises from the use of the `call` method for transferring ETH without any fallback mechanism to handle potential failures.
```solidity
456:     function _transfer(address _to, uint256 _amount) internal {
457:         if (_amount > 0) {
458:             (bool success, ) = _to.call{value: _amount}("");
459:@=>          require(success, "Rollup: ETH transfer failed");
460:         }
461:     }
```
The `require(success, "Rollup: ETH transfer failed");` statement ensures that the transaction reverts if the transfer fails, but does not provide any alternative handling or retry mechanism.

## Impact
If the transfer fails, the ETH remains locked in the contract, inaccessible to the intended recipient.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Implement a more robust transfer mechanism that includes a fallback strategy to handle failed ETH transfers.
```diff
function _transfer(address _to, uint256 _amount) internal {
+   require(_amount > 0, "Amount must be greater than zero");

-   if (_amount > 0) {
    // Attempt to send ETH using call
    (bool success, ) = _to.call{value: _amount}("");
+   if (!success) {
        // Log the failure for further investigation
-       require(success, "Rollup: ETH transfer failed");
+       emit TransferFailed(_to, _amount);

        // Optionally, implement a retry mechanism or alternative handling
        // For example, queue the transfer for manual intervention
    }
}

// Event to log failed transfers
+ event TransferFailed(address indexed to, uint256 amount);
```
