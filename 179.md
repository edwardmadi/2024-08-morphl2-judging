# Users can wait until the last moment to delegate therefore defeating the delegation logic

### Description
The [`DelegateStake`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-morphl2/blob/main/morph/contracts/contracts/l2/staking/L2Staking.sol#L284-L340) function allows a user to delegate a specific amount of stake to a `delegatee`. Inside this function, there is an important check:

```javascript
   uint256 effectiveEpoch = rewardStarted ? currentEpoch() + 1 : 0;
```

This check ensures the correct epoch is assigned. If the reward process has already started (`rewardStarted` is `true`), the epoch is set to `currentEpoch() + 1`; otherwise, it is set to 0. 

In practice, this means that if a user calls the function before the reward has begun, they will receive rewards for the current epoch. However, if the reward process has started, the rewards will only begin accruing from the next epoch.

For `rewardStarted` to be set to `true`, the contract owner must call the `startReward` function:

```javascript
    function startReward() external onlyOwner {
        require(block.timestamp >= rewardStartTime, "can't start before reward start time");
        require(candidateNumber > 0, "none candidate");

        rewardStarted = true;
    }
```

This function ensures that the rewards process begins only after the specified reward start time and that there are valid candidates for delegation. When called, it sets `rewardStarted` to `true`.

With this mechanism in mind, a user can exploit this system to optimize their rewards by timing their actions strategically and having 0 to little risk. For instance:

- Bob waits for the Owner to call `startReward`.
- As soon as `startReward` is executed, Bob frontruns by calling `DelegateStake` immediately.
- Bob carefully selects the most profitable sequencer based on which one has produced the most blocks (since rewards are tied to block production).
- Bob stakes for a very short period, but because of the timing, he will still be eligible for the full rewards for the epoch and will minimalize his risks

Ultimately this defeats the purpose of staking since the users are not incentivised  to stake from the beginning and can just wait seconds before the reward period starts.

This setup is highly appealing to whale investors, as they can select the most profitable sequencer, maximize their returns, and then unstake in the following epoch with no risk involved. However, it poses significant disadvantages for sequencers. They may be discouraged from continuing to provide services, as they might not receive any stake until the very last moments before rewards are distributed, creating a great deal of uncertainty for them.

### Recommendation
Currently, users have no incentive to stake at the beginning of an epoch and are more likely to wait until just before it ends. It might be wise to introduce measures that encourage early staking.
