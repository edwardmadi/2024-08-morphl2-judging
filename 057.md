# ERC1155 Token Minting May Fail in L2ERC1155Gateway

## Summary
The [L2ERC1155Gateway](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-morphl2/blob/main/morph/contracts/contracts/l2/gateways/L2ERC1155Gateway.sol) contract may fail to mint `ERC1155` tokens when finalizing deposits if the recipient address `_to` is a contract that does not implement the `IERC1155Receiver` interface. This issue can cause transaction reversion on Layer 2 (L2), resulting in tokens not being minted on L2 and potentially locking funds on Layer 1 (L1).
## Vulnerability Detail
In the [L2ERC1155Gateway](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-morphl2/blob/main/morph/contracts/contracts/l2/gateways/L2ERC1155Gateway.sol) contract, the functions [finalizeDepositERC1155](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-morphl2/blob/main/morph/contracts/contracts/l2/gateways/L2ERC1155Gateway.sol#L101-L132) and [finalizeBatchDepositERC1155](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-morphl2/blob/main/morph/contracts/contracts/l2/gateways/L2ERC1155Gateway.sol#L101-L132) are responsible for minting ERC1155 tokens on L2 when a deposit is finalized. These functions call the mint or batchMint methods of the ERC1155 token contract ([IMorphERC1155](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-morphl2/blob/main/morph/contracts/contracts/libraries/token/IMorphERC1155Extension.sol)):
```solidity
IMorphERC1155(_l2Token).mint(_to, _tokenId, _amount, "");
```
When tokens are minted or transferred to a contract address, a safe transfer check is performed by calling `_doSafeTransferAcceptanceCheck`. This function invokes `onERC1155Received` on the recipient contract:
```solidity
_doSafeTransferAcceptanceCheck(operator, address(0), to, id, amount, data);
```
If the recipient contract `(_to)` does not implement the `IERC1155Receiver` interface and the `onERC1155Received` function, the safe transfer acceptance check fails, causing the entire transaction to revert.

Why This Is a Problem?:
1.  Reverting the transaction means that the minting process fails, and the tokens are not minted on L2.
2. The user's tokens remain on L1, but since the corresponding minting on L2 failed, the user cannot access their funds on L2.
3. Users depositing tokens to contracts not compatible with `IERC1155Receiver` may lose access to their assets without an obvious cause.

## Impact
Users may be unable to access their tokens on L2 after deposit because a reversion could result in the ERC1155 tokens becoming stuck in the L1 gateway

## Code Snippet
```solidity
    /// @inheritdoc IL2ERC1155Gateway
    function finalizeDepositERC1155(
        address _l1Token,
        address _l2Token,
        address _from,
        address _to,
        uint256 _tokenId,
        uint256 _amount
    ) external virtual onlyCallByCounterpart nonReentrant {
        require(_l1Token != address(0), "token address cannot be 0");
        require(_l1Token == tokenMapping[_l2Token], "l2 token mismatch");

        IMorphERC1155(_l2Token).mint(_to, _tokenId, _amount, "");

        emit FinalizeDepositERC1155(_l1Token, _l2Token, _from, _to, _tokenId, _amount);
    }

    /// @inheritdoc IL2ERC1155Gateway
    function finalizeBatchDepositERC1155(
        address _l1Token,
        address _l2Token,
        address _from,
        address _to,
        uint256[] calldata _tokenIds,
        uint256[] calldata _amounts
    ) external virtual onlyCallByCounterpart nonReentrant {
        require(_l1Token != address(0), "token address cannot be 0");
        require(_l1Token == tokenMapping[_l2Token], "l2 token mismatch");

        IMorphERC1155(_l2Token).batchMint(_to, _tokenIds, _amounts, "");

        emit FinalizeBatchDepositERC1155(_l1Token, _l2Token, _from, _to, _tokenIds, _amounts);
    }
``` 
## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Before minting, check if the recipient address `_to` is a contract and whether it implements the `IERC1155Receiver` interface. This can prevent transaction reversion due to incompatible recipient contracts.

 Ideally, in the future, a system should be implemented to check the Merkle tree and recover the ERC1155 tokens if the message fails on L2.
