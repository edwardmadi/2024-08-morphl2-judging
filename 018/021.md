# Duplicate Token Mapping in `updateTokenMapping` Function

## Summary
The `updateTokenMapping` function in the `L2ERC1155Gateway` contract allows the owner to update the mapping between L2 and L1 token addresses. However, the function lacks validation to prevent a single L1 token address from being mapped to multiple L2 token addresses, leading to potential conflicts and operational errors.

## Vulnerability Detail
The root cause of the lies in the absence of a check to ensure that an L1 token address is not already mapped to another L2 token address. This oversight allows for the possibility of mapping the same L1 token address to multiple L2 token addresses, creating ambiguity in cross-chain operations.
```solidity
File: d:\project\MorphL2\MorphL2\contracts\l2\gateways\L2ERC1155Gateway.sol
141:     function updateTokenMapping(address _l2Token, address _l1Token) external onlyOwner {
142:         require(_l1Token != address(0), "token address cannot be 0");
---
144:@=>      address _oldL1Token = tokenMapping[_l2Token];
145:         tokenMapping[_l2Token] = _l1Token;
---
147:         emit UpdateTokenMapping(_l2Token, _oldL1Token, _l1Token);
148:     }
```
The problem is that there is no check to ensure `_l1Token` is not already mapped to another `_l2Token`.

## Impact
A single L1 token address mapped to multiple L2 token addresses can lead to operational conflicts, making it unclear which L2 token corresponds to the L1 token during cross-chain operations like deposits and withdrawals.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Implement a check to ensure that an L1 token address is not already mapped to another L2 token address before updating the mapping.
```diff
function updateTokenMapping(address _l2Token, address _l1Token) external onlyOwner {
    require(_l1Token != address(0), "token address cannot be 0");

    // Check if the L1 token is already mapped to another L2 token
+   for (address l2Token : tokenMapping) {
+       require(tokenMapping[l2Token] != _l1Token, "L1 token already mapped to another L2 token");
    }

    address _oldL1Token = tokenMapping[_l2Token];
    tokenMapping[_l2Token] = _l1Token;

    emit UpdateTokenMapping(_l2Token, _oldL1Token, _l1Token);
}
```
