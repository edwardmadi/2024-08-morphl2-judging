# Centralized Control Over Token Mapping in updateTokenMapping Leading to Potential Compromise in L1ERC721Gateway Contract

## Summary

https://github.com/morph-l2/morph/blob/main/contracts/contracts/l1/gateways/L1ERC721Gateway.sol#L157

The updateTokenMapping function in the L1ERC721Gateway contract allows the owner to update the mapping between Layer 1 (L1) and Layer 2 (L2) ERC721 tokens. 

This gives the owner centralized control over a critical aspect of the contract, creating a single point of failure. If the owner’s private key is compromised, or if the owner acts maliciously, token mappings could be altered to point to malicious contracts. 

This could result in users losing their NFTs or interacting with fraudulent contracts.


## Vulnerability Details

The updateTokenMapping function is restricted by the onlyOwner modifier, meaning only the contract owner has the power to update the token mapping between L1 and L2 tokens.


The function controls the correspondence between ERC721 tokens on L1 and their counterparts on L2. Any incorrect or malicious updates to this mapping can mislead users who are depositing and withdrawing their NFTs across chains.


If the owner’s private key is compromised, an attacker could update the mappings to point to malicious L2 token contracts. 


Users depositing NFTs into the gateway may unknowingly send their assets to unsafe or fraudulent contracts on L2, where the NFTs could be stolen, frozen, or lost.





## Code snippet

```solidity

function updateTokenMapping(address _l1Token, address _l2Token) external onlyOwner {

    require(_l2Token != address(0), "token address cannot be 0");



    address _oldL2Token = tokenMapping[_l1Token];

    tokenMapping[_l1Token] = _l2Token;



    emit UpdateTokenMapping(_l1Token, _oldL2Token, _l2Token);

}


```

## Impact

If token mappings are updated to point to malicious or incorrect L2 contracts, users may lose their NFTs upon deposit or withdrawal. This would lead to severe financial and reputational damage.

Incorrect mappings could result in users being unable to withdraw their NFTs back to L1, effectively locking their assets in the gateway.

Malicious token mappings could reroute NFTs to unauthorized recipients during withdrawals, allowing an attacker to steal assets.


 Centralized control undermines the trust users place in the gateway, particularly when they cannot be sure their NFTs are being mapped correctly between layers.


## Recommendations 

Implement Multi-Signature Wallet for Ownership:


Transfer the contract’s ownership to a multi-signature (multisig) wallet, requiring multiple trusted parties to approve token mapping updates. This significantly reduces the risk posed by a single compromised account.
Example: A 3-of-5 multisig wallet ensures that at least three signatories must approve a change to token mappings before it can be executed.



transferOwnership(multisigWalletAddress);



Introduce a Time-Lock Mechanism:

Add a time-lock for token mapping updates, requiring a delay (e.g., 24 hours) before changes are executed. This gives users and stakeholders time to review and respond to potentially malicious updates.

```solidity

mapping(address => uint256) public pendingUpdates;

uint256 constant TIME_LOCK_PERIOD = 24 hours;



function updateTokenMapping(address _l1Token, address _l2Token) external onlyOwner {

    require(block.timestamp >= pendingUpdates[_l1Token], "Time-lock period has not elapsed");

    pendingUpdates[_l1Token] = block.timestamp + TIME_LOCK_PERIOD;

    // ... logic to update token mapping

}

```
