# Cross-chain messages do not commit to a chain Id, allowing messages to be replayed in case of an L2 hardfork

### Summary

The `L1CrossDomainMessenger` does not include a chain ID in the cross-domain message hash. This allows an attacker to replay cross-chain transactions in case of an L2 hardfork, allowing them to double-withdraw funds.


### Root Cause

[`L1CrossDomainMessenger.sol::_sendMessage`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-morphl2/blob/98e0ec4c5bbd0b28f3d3a9e9159d1184bc45b38d/morph/contracts/contracts/l1/L1CrossDomainMessenger.sol#L335) does not include a chain ID when calling `_encodeXDomainCalldata`.


### Internal pre-conditions

None

### External pre-conditions

Hardfork of L2


### Attack Path

* User submits `L1 -> L2` deposit
* L2 hardforks
* The transaction created on L2 by the sequencer can now be replayed on the forked chain, allowing the attacker to gain their deposit on two chains, effectively doubling it


### Impact

Loss of funds


### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Commit to a chain ID when sending messages from `L1 -> L2` and verify that the chain ID matches the current chain ID on the executing chain.
