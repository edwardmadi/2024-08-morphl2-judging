# Stakers who are part of the sequencerSet and exit on the L1 may not be able to claim the comissions of the last epoch(s) when they were active

### Summary

The rewards (and comissions) for the sequencers are distributed at least in the next epoch to the current epoch.

[`Record.recordRewardEpochs()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-morphl2/blob/main/morph/contracts/contracts/l2/staking/Record.sol#L163C14-L169)
```solidity
function recordRewardEpochs(RewardEpochInfo[] calldata _rewardEpochs) external onlyOracle {
    ...

    //@audit => Rewards can be recorded/distributed at most 1 epoch prior to the current epoch!
    //@audit => Rewards for the current epoch are distributed only after the epoch has ended!
    require(
        nextRewardEpochIndex + _rewardEpochs.length - 1 < IL2Staking(L2_STAKING_CONTRACT).currentEpoch(),
        "unfinished epochs cannot be uploaded"
    );
    
    ...
}
```

There can be stakers that belongs to the sequencerSet and exits the staking on the L1 contract. When the L2Staking contract is notified about the Staker exiting on the L1, the L2Staking contract removes the staker from the sequencerSet as well as it resets the staker's `stakerRankings` to 0.
- When the stakerRankings of an address is 0, the L2Staking contract considers that such an address is not a staker.

[`L2Staking.removeStakers()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-morphl2/blob/main/morph/contracts/contracts/l2/staking/L2Staking.sol#L186-L187)
```solidity
function removeStakers(address[] calldata remove) external onlyOtherStaking {
    ...
          //@audit => When the L2 is notified about the Staker exiting on the L1, the `stakerRankings` is reset to default values (0).
            stakerAddresses.pop();
            delete stakerRankings[remove[i]];

    ...
}
```

The problem is that the [`L2Staking.claimComission() function`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-morphl2/blob/main/morph/contracts/contracts/l2/staking/L2Staking.sol#L215-L217) only allows active stakers to claim comissions.
- Stakers who exited on the L1 && were part of the sequencerSet in the epoch when they exited are affected by this restriction, the reason is because by the time when rewards for the epoch when they exited are distributed, the Staker's address is no longer consider an active staker, which, causes that the at the very least, the staker can not claim its earned comissions of the last epoch (this assuming that all the previous epochs were already awarded, and, that the staker claimed all the previous rewards).

[`L2Staking.claimCommission()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-morphl2/blob/main/morph/contracts/contracts/l2/staking/L2Staking.sol#L215-L217)

```solidity
modifier onlyStaker() {
  //@audit => To claim comission, the caller must be an active staker
    require(stakerRankings[_msgSender()] > 0, "only staker allowed");
    _;
}

function claimCommission(uint256 targetEpochIndex) external onlyStaker nonReentrant {
    IDistribute(DISTRIBUTE_CONTRACT).claimCommission(_msgSender(), targetEpochIndex);
}
```

### Root Cause

Limiting only active stakers to be able to claim comissions causes that stakers who were part of the sequencerSet, and, exitted on the L1 to not be able to claim the comissions generated for all the epochs that were pending to be awarded, including the last epoch when they exited on L1.

### Internal pre-conditions

- Staker is part of the sequencerSet and exits on the L1.

### External pre-conditions

none

### Attack Path

1. A Staker is part of the sequencerSet and is producing blocks.
2. Staker exits on the L1 in the current epoch.
3. The L2 receives the message about the Staker exiting the Staking on L1.
4. Staker is removed from the Staking in L2.
5. The current epoch is over and later comissions are distributed.
6. The staker won't be able to claim his corresponding comissions for the blocks generated during his last epoch.
7. Unclaimable comissions will get stuck in the Distribution contract.

### Impact

Staker who were part of the sequencerSet and exists on the L1 won't be able to claim all of their comissions.
- At the very least, the comissions for the staker's last active epoch won't be claimable, as such, those Tokens will get stuck in the Distribution contract.

### PoC

No coded PoC, all the details of the bug are described in the Summary section

### Mitigation

Remove the `onlyStaker()` modifier in the [`claimCommission() function`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-morphl2/blob/main/morph/contracts/contracts/l2/staking/L2Staking.sol#L215-L217), the Distribute contract has the record of how much comissions each address can claim, if an address that had not accrued any comission attempts to claim comissions, the Distribute contract will not send any tokens.
```solidity
- function claimCommission(uint256 targetEpochIndex) external onlyStaker nonReentrant {
+ function claimCommission(uint256 targetEpochIndex) external nonReentrant {
    IDistribute(DISTRIBUTE_CONTRACT).claimCommission(_msgSender(), targetEpochIndex);
}
```
