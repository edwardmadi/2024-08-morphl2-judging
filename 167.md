# Staker on L2 can trick users into thinking their commission is very low

### Summary

Users delegating their stake to a staker on L2 have no guarantee that they get the rewards they expected since stakers can change their commission rate arbitrarily, tricking users into thinking it is very low.

### Root Cause

With [`L2Staking.sol::setCommissionRate`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-morphl2/blob/98e0ec4c5bbd0b28f3d3a9e9159d1184bc45b38d/morph/contracts/contracts/l2/staking/L2Staking.sol#L206-L211), stakers on L2 can set their commission rate arbitrarily between `0% - 20%` with no other restrictions.

### Internal pre-conditions

None

### External pre-conditions

None

### Attack Path

* Staker sets commission rate to `0%`
* Users delegate to him, thinking they get a very good deal
* Shortly before the rewards get paid out, the staker changes their commission rate to `20%`
* The user now gets less rewards than he expected


### Impact

Loss of rewards for users


### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Consider adding some kind of "slippage" protection to protect users from arbitrary changes to a staker's commission rate.
